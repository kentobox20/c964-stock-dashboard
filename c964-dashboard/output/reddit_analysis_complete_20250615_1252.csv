stocks,India orders inspection of Boeing 787s after Air India crash,"India’s aviation regulator has ordered all Boeing 787s being operated by local carriers to be inspected after an Air India crash killed 270 people this week, the aviation minister said on Saturday, adding the authorities were investigating all possible causes.

The aviation regulator on Friday ordered Air India to conduct additional maintenance checks on its Boeing 787-8/9 aircraft equipped with GEnx engines, including assessments of certain take-off parameters, electronic engine control tests and engine fuel-related checks. “We have also given the order to do the extended surveillance of the 787 planes. There are 34 in our Indian fleet,” aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu told a media briefing in New Delhi. “Eight have already been inspected and with immediate urgency, all of them are going to be done.”

Air India and the Indian government were looking at several aspects of the crash including issues linked to its engine thrust, flaps, and why the landing gear remained open as the plane took off and then came down, Reuters has reported. Naidu said a government panel was investigating the crash and will issue a report within three months. “We are going to improve every necessary thing that is going to come our way, to improve the safety,” he said at the briefing, declining questions from journalists.

\*Boeing's stock is down \~6% since the incident.

stocks,To those that mostly passively invest but set aside play money at a smaller percentage,"My dad is a degenerate gambler who blew up his own 401k as well as my moms (divorced now).  I’m probably more risky than some investors but a good deal of risk aversion from using my dad as an example in life. 

My problem is that for decades I have outperformed the market using a mix of passive and active investing but I have always reeled profits back into index investing.  The track record and history and math so far says I may do better if I was even more active an investor then passive.  The passive index angel on my shoulder tells me of course to not be cocky and the moment I do so I may lose a lot more then I anticipate. 

For example for today’s drawdown my own active investments made me lose $7.99 today.  When my mutual funds kicked in after market I was down almost 12k but still doing better than S&P.  The math says had I made my active portfolio a greater percentage of my funds than passive I would have reduced the loss significantly.  

And let’s say I am just cherry picking with selection bias. What if it is just time and time again for many years my active investments have done pretty amazing.  How many of you ever stop listening to the passive index investing angel on the shoulder and start listening to the active investor devil?

I have always kept my investments true to goals with healthy risk aversion despite literally decades telling me my active investment portfolio and choices do more than alright.  I would love to hear advice or thoughts of those in similar positions.  Not from people that have done awfully in active investments but those that have done amazing and need to make that decision to still keep their active investments in absolute check.  Or those that said to hell with it and went with active investments to either their benefit or detriment.

There's a lot on the domestic calendar this week. But investors and the world are watching global affairs, too.

Meanwhile, several market-driving events are due in the coming days. The Federal Reserve's interest rate decision, consumer spending data, and possible news on President Donald Trump's tariffs headline the week. Thursday's Juneteenth holiday will mean a break from trading.

The Fed will hand down another decision on interest rates this week, with a decision scheduled for Wednesday. The coming weekend could see Tesla providing a significant update on the direction of the electric vehicle maker.

Did consumers in May continue to prop up the economy? Tuesday's U.S. retail sales will make it clear whether strong spending levels continued, while housing construction data will provide insight into whether builders are catching up with lagging inventory levels. Investors will continue to watch for trade developments as negotiations continue between U.S. officials and key trading partners.

It’s a light week for corporate earnings, highlighted by expected reports from homebuilder Lennar, accounting firm Accenture, grocery chain Kroger, and online used car seller CarMax.

# Fed Interest-Rate Decision Comes Amid Increasing Pressure for Cuts

Fed officials have said they are keeping rates steady amid a strong labor market as they monitor inflation data for signs that Trump’s tariffs are driving up prices.

But the pressure is on the Federal Reserve after May inflation data came in lower than economists expected. Despite comments from President Donald Trump urging the Fed to make a one-point cut, investors don't expect the central bank to take action when its two-day meeting concludes on Wednesday.

The CME FedWatch Tool, which measures fed funds futures to determine the path of interest rates, indicates that traders overwhelmingly believe that Fed will keep rates at their current levels in June. They also don't expect the central bank to move rates at its late July meeting.

After the meeting concludes on Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell will provide more insight into the central bank’s view on the economy and interest rates when he takes media questions.

On Tuesday, retail sales figures from May will provide another barometer of the economy's health Consumer spending makes up about two-thirds of the U.S. economy. Meanwhile, housing data will also be scrutinized as affordability issues continue to depress home sales. The latest homebuilder confidence reading on Tuesday will show if construction industry officials see improvements coming in the market, while Wednesday’s housing starts data will indicate whether construction levels are rising amid a need for more housing inventory.

# Tesla Robotaxi Rollout Could Come as Early as Sunday

After months of waiting, investors could soon get a key update from electric vehicle maker Tesla (TSLA). CEO Elon Musk said in a recent social media post that the company could roll out its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, as early as Sunday, June 22. ""We are being super paranoid about safety, so the date could shift,"" Musk wrote.

The introduction of the company's robotaxi service could be a key moment for Tesla, which is banking on artificial intelligence (AI) and self-driving vehicles to become the transportation technologies of the future. Tesla is well-positioned to lead the market in the emerging technology, analysts have concluded, with Goldman Sachs writing that the EV maker could have a leg up on the competition through its ability to train self-driving through its AI development and to quickly scale production levels of the technology.

Despite a light corporate earnings schedule this week, investors will still get some expected updates from noteworthy companies.

Lennar’s (LEN) expected report after the bell on Monday follows the homebuilder's warning of weakness in the housing market in the prior quarter.  The scheduled Friday reports from accounting firm Accenture (ACN) and online car seller CarMax (KMX) will be posted in the shadow of both companies' lower-than-expected profits in the prior quarter.

stocks,AI related stocks,"Hi everyone,

I have conducted research on AI infrastructure and applications, but I have some questions and would appreciate hearing from you.

Five companies benefit from AI:

[NVDA ](https://knkresearchai.com/report/NVDA)\- Of course, it is the base of all AI infrastructure. It positions itself as the most efficient “calculation engine,” like the classic shovel-seller in a modern AI gold rush. So as long as no one can compete with its speed of calculations, then it is still the king.

[MSFT ](https://knkresearchai.com/report/MSFT)\- I reckon it's the doorway to corporate data. Most government entities, large enterprises, and SMEs have to rely on MSFT for everyday work, so it stores all data from Word, PDF, and the cloud. So as long as it wants to help corporations dig into their digital gold, it can be very fast and efficient. Btw, lots of enterprises who use Azure have to use MSFT cloud as well as an additional backup, because 1) data security reasons (like banks) 2) they have to use MSFT everyday so it is logically easier to store their data into MSFT (Teams).

[AMZN](https://knkresearchai.com/report/AMZN) \- Azure has the largest market share of cloud business (also big R&D in its own GPUs). And it has complex logistic and e-commerce businesses that benefit from cost-saving in AI adoption. So they have a slice of pie as well. However, currently the Tariff shadow their sky, as too much uncertainties of supply chain of e-commerce cross boarder businesses make investor nervous.

[Oracle ](https://knkresearchai.com/report/AMZN)\- Lots of businesses are using Oracle for their data management tools, so it can help data rich companies to adapt, deploy and transform quickly. Stargate is also a big benefit project that people ignore. However, one thing I did not understand is how technically differentiated their stack is compared to AWS or Azure.

[PLTR ](https://knkresearchai.com/report/PLTR)\- PLTR's AI deployment across government and enterprise has lots of recently, and it has an army of engineers to stay in their clients' offices to automate workflow and applications. However, what I do not figure out is their high valuations. Am I underestimating the breakout growth?

[GOOGLE ](https://knkresearchai.com/report/GOOGL)\- As many friends mention about Google, I think I should also include it in my list. Google’s tech is very deep, and it is truly undervalued. But my major concern is that its main business is traditional searching (90%), which is like a blue whale. However, all others like Openai, Perplexity, Claude, Grok are all like sharks with sharp teeth (new LLM models); they all want to eat Google’s main business for lunch. So Google’s battle will be very tough (too big, too old, too many managers, and little incentive for self-revenue disruptive innovations). If Google does not handle them well, it will lose its major revenue stream. If it battles well, it will kill its own core business (innovator’s dilemma). So funds are very conservative about it, and thus it is cheap for a reason.

I think MSFT and NVDA still lead the pack, but I’m curious if ORCL will follow PLTR's growth story. What do you think about them? Which one is a ten-bagger?",linkluke18,94.36849999999998,10,2025-06-15 04:36:00,"['Is this a chat gpt 2.5 post', 'Just buy the S&P buddy.', 'Going forward, google is the AI stock to buy and hold.

stocks,All time highs on the horizon,"Nvidia Corporation is attractively valued and its strong EPS growth and profitability outpacing peers make it a compelling entry point. AI-driven demand from hyperscalers and new sovereign deals (UAE, Saudi Arabia) provides long-term headroom for continued growth. Despite the loss of China revenues and recent price stagnation, NVIDIA's fundamentals remain strong and its market leadership unquestioned. I am upgrading my rating on NVDA stock to Strong Buy, believing it is capable of delivering superior returns and has the potential to reach a $10 trillion valuation.



When I looked at NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ) late last year, I thought the stock had a pretty good shot at 2025. While the stock has soared, the valuation has fallen because of strong earnings growth, thanks in large part to the seemingly never-ending demand for GPUs in exascale computing platforms. 2025 was destined to be the “Year of Blackwell,” and I expected the stock to continue to rise, albeit at a slower pace than in previous years.

Instead, we saw the stock briefly try to break out to a new all-time high, or ATH, before reversing sharply and selling off. We know the various reasons for this reversal. On the one hand, the broader market sold off amid tariff uncertainty, and few companies were immune. the release of DeepSeek (DEEPSEEK) in early 2025 triggered a sort of flash panic, with some claiming that the boom time for high-end chips was over. The logic was that DeepSeek would be able to save costs and increase efficiency so dramatically that companies running AI reasoning could rely on much less powerful chips. I think the evidence so far is that this reasoning is completely wrong, and instead we're seeing the Jevons Paradox come true.

It was probably inevitable that NVIDIA would now lose essentially all of its China-related revenue. At a recent conference, CFO Colette Kress pretty much poured cold water on the company's prospects for generating further revenue in China.

In my opinion, NVIDIA is attractively valued. The two best performers this year among the Big 7 tech giants have been Microsoft and Meta. looking at how NVIDIA compares to these peers, I see a big gap between them at the moment. In terms of price-to-earnings ratio, NVIDIA's valuation sits right in the middle of the three, but in terms of return on invested capital and medium-term EPS projections, it's way ahead.",Aluseda,96.9165,5,2025-06-15 11:41:16,"['What is this shit', 'You think we should invest in Nvidia?

investing,Thinking about my future instead of sleeping,"Hi everyone,

I'm 19 and currently attending university, next year instead of moving straight into third year, I have the opportunity to do something called a placement year with a company of my choice.

For those of you eho don't know what a placement year is, it is a full/most of a year where you gain real world experience within a company that you apply for, just like a normal job. The great thing is you get experience and develop skills in your chosen industry whilst also getting paid a decent salary of around £25,000 annually (As you can tell by the pound symbol I live in the UK).

I am pretty much set on doing a placement year and plan to save most of my money that I earn from this in my long term investment portfolio. 

I have two roads that I can choose from.

My question that I would love for you guys to help me with is if I should use those savings to pay off my third year of Univeristy. Unfortunately in the UK, an undergraduate degree is not free and I have already taken loans for my first and second years at £9,250 per year. By paying of my third year from my own pocket (savings), I essentially have less debt and will also not suffer from the ludicrous interest in a loan at least for that year. 

My other option instead is to use that money and to save it all into my long term portfolio where in especially a few decades down the line I would have profitted immensely from starting at what I hope is a young age.

investing,The question that is always on my mind.,"I’m 37, and I keep on doing a ton of mathematical gymnastics with all the different dividends yields, and it always comes back to the same thing: if you got 20 to 30 years in the market, then just go VOO all the way through the ups and the downs. You’ll come out ahead in total market value (with dividends reinvested) almost every time compared to 99% of other dividend ETF combinations.

THEN you can play the dividend game 20-30 years later when you’ve amassed a nice chunk of value from all that market appreciation growth with VOO. Yes, you’d have to sell your asset to then buy a new one(s) that generates you income. But doing exactly that, compared to having a strictly income oriented dividend portfolio for 20-30 years (with all dividends reinvested), will give you MORE monthly income because the value of your dividend giving equity is now far greater due to your sale of a different equity that grew much quicker. For example: it’s better to buy VOO for 30 years, then sell it and buy SCHD to live off dividends. Compared to JUST buying (and using DRIP) on SCHD for 30 years and then live of its dividends.

Right?

I know this question gets asked a lot and this topic is always brought up but I kinda want a clear answer on it: if I don’t care about the dividends until my year based goal - then should I just absolutely forget about dividends and yields and CAGR and all that jazz for the next next couple of decades and come back to it later once I’ve amassed wealth in VOO ( or even a more growth oriented ETF like SCHG or QQQM)?",jmill388,100.15449999999998,14,2025-06-15 03:26:21,"['Or you know, not chase dividends at all.', 'Dividends are just part of the total return.

Depends on the end goal', ""Risk vs. return and also business model.\n\n  \nRisk vs. return - mortgages are very very low risk.  If they qualify to be guaranteed by Fannie or Freddie than the mortgage is almost as safe as treasuries (although the interest rate risk is more dynamic).  Stocks are risky.  You are being paid to take this risk.  There is price risk (stocks go up and down a lot) and bankruptcy risk (each company has a small chance to never pay you back).  A stock investor cannot foreclose on anything.  Some investors (like banks) have very sensible limitations on their risk and some investors just choose to not take high risks.\n\n  \nBusiness model - you are a 'long only' investor and banks are 'spread' investors.  Long only investors have a fixed pile of money and can choose to invest it in one thing or another.  Banks make money by funding loans (including mortgages) with liabilities which include deposits.  If the bank can make more on the loan than it pays on the deposit it keeps the spread.  The difference in these interest rates is called the net interest margin.

It sells the loan to Fannie or Freddie for cash, may keep the servicing, and you keep paying the loan exactly as before. Your dollars ultimately flow (minus small servicing and guarantee slices) to bondholders, while the agencies stand behind the stream of payments. Basically:\n\n1. On closing day, the bank wires the money to the home seller.\n\n2. Then, very quickly, the bank sells that mortgage to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. The bank gets all its money back and it can issue new loans.\n\n3.

Financial institutions have money to lend. That’s why they exist, they  are trying to make money off their capital. You as an individual investor don’t have access to the entirety of the US market. There are doors that you can’t open because you don’t have enough capital. It’s not easy to open those markets with capital as it is. Financial institutions are working to capitalize opportunities. One of those opportunities is to lend money out on mortgages, repackage those and make a sizable profit based on an almost sure thing. \n\nThe entire purpose of the American experience is wealth extraction. A mortgage is a way to leverage a bank so that you can save money and build wealth. If you pay your  mortgage off, all you are doing is extracting your own wealth because you gave up your time and money to pay the mortgage off. You can get the time back hence the opportunity cost.', ""The key thing you’re overlooking is that banks do invest just not the same way retail does.\n\nBanks lend at a lower, but guaranteed return (like 5–7% on mortgages) because they’re playing the long game with risk adjusted yield and collateral backed loans. They aren’t trying to outperform the market they’re managing risk and maintaining cash flow.\n\nAlso they absolutely do invest in the markets through proprietary trading desks, asset management divisions and indirect exposure via ETFs and equities. But when it comes to lending it’s about consistent, secured returns. Lending to homeowners with 20–30 year repayment windows and collateral (your house) is a lot less risky than throwing billions at Tesla stock.\n\nIt’s not one or the other. It’s about how much risk you can afford to take and banks are masters at balancing both.\n\nThe reason investing rather than paying off your mortgage early can make more sense is that if the expected market return exceeds your mortgage interest rate then you're likely to build wealth faster. For example if your mortgage rate is 4%, but you can reasonably earn 7–10% annually in the market, which has historically been the average return for mutual funds like the S&P 500, then investing gives you a better long term outcome while still making minimum payments on the loan. It comes down to opportunity cost and putting your money where it works hardest."", ""Pay an extra $100 a month against the principal. You'll save a huge amount of interest/money ! That savings can then be invested."", "">Guaranteed returns vs risk, thats why.\n\nThe amount of misinformation for this question is…  I'm not an expert.  It's been years since I've taken banking law, but I remember that generally, banks are not allowed to invest in stocks, businesses, etc.\n\nWhy?  Well, it's been like this for decades, it not centuries, ago.  I'm not going to spend time looking up the exact enactment of the law but the history goes somthig like this.  Long ago, we, as a society, found that the ability to collect deposits is extremely potent.  So, if we allowed local banks, who collect deposits from the community, to start investing in local businesses, they would start owning *everything*.  As a result, the law is extremely strict in this.  Commercial banks are only allowed to loan money out for mortgages, lines of credit, etc.  They themselves can't own anything.  So, even when someone defaults on their mortgage, the banks themselves can't just own the home.  They need to get rid of it.  And any *profit* must go to the former owner.\n\nThis is why there was such a big issue between linking commercial banks and investment banks as one company since investment banks are allowed to invest in anything.  The law was relaxed several years ago, and now they can go into both businesses.  Of course, they have to be cordoned off.\n\nA common loophole to this, which I am pretty sure that people violate frequently is that someone will buy a bank.  Then they will indirectly get the bank loan to projects owned by this person.  This is highly illegal but it's still done, I believe.  I've seen it happen.\n\nAnother loophole is that when someone defaults (foreclosure), the bank will quietly give an insider the ability to buy the property at a massively reduced price.  This doesn't hurt the bank because they can't get any of the profits anyway if there was any.  Again, this is all highly illegal.  And, again, something I used to see frequently when I used to do real estate.\n\nAgain, I'm not an expert on this so I'm just citing stuff that I only know is generally true.  If you want to know more, go look up the wiki on banking.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI'm a totally different note.  The risk profiles for mortgages and investemtns are totally different.  This is the reason why the returns differ.  A mortgage's return is based on a mortgagee's ability to pay (aka his job, etc.).  That's much safer than the volaitlity from a business."", 'why wont a bank invest in the market with risk when they can easily just rape the consumer with interest rates where they compound by fronting your money up instead of their own to make interest on top of that also?\n\n\n\ni dont know man.. compound interest is such a weak return....\n\n....\n\n/s', 'Remember for the rest of your life: first you get rid of all possible debts you have.

I’m currently researching **“winner” investment theses selected by VIC**.

My goal is to analyze and learn from these top-rated ideas, and eventually write a post discussing key patterns, insights, and what makes a VIC thesis exceptional.

If you have a list of your favorite VIC “winner” write-ups (or know where to find a good collection of them), I’d really appreciate it.

**P.S.** I’ve already come across some great theses — both “winners” and not — written by or attributed to well-known investors like **Mohnish Pabrai, Michael Burry, and Norbert Lou**. But for this project, I'm aiming to go beyond the big names and focus on VIC’s own selection of **winning ideas**, regardless of who authored them.

StockMarket,Global Liquidity Tide Is finally Rising Once Again,"The world’s major central banks have already begun to tiptoe away from 2022-24’s broad tightening. Policy rates are being cut, money-supply growth has turned positive again, and even the Federal Reserve has started to slow quantitative-tightening. 

That said, the shift is cautious: real policy rates are still above zero in most advanced economies, balance-sheet runoff is only tapering (not reversing), and inflation is still hovering above target. In other words, the expansion cycle is underway, yet it remains early, deliberate and fragile.

Why the pivot is considered an “expansion cycle”

A monetary expansion is usually marked by three concurrent signals: lower policy rates, rising money-supply/credit growth, and central-bank balance-sheet support. When all three start moving in the same direction, liquidity conditions ease for households and firms, setting the stage for the next growth upswing.

Key evidence so far

Federal Reserve – mild but clear easing bias
After lifting the fed-funds rate to 4.50 % in 2023, the Fed cut three times in 2024. Futures now price two more quarter-point cuts by October 2025 while policymakers project the same number in their “dot plot”.  ￼
QT is still running, yet the FOMC voted on 19 March 2025 to slow the monthly runoff cap – an explicit step toward ending balance-sheet shrinkage.  ￼ ￼

European Central Bank – eight cuts and counting
The ECB lowered its deposit rate again in early June, to 2 %, its eighth cut since June 2024, comfortably moving policy back inside its estimated neutral range. Bank of England delivered its first trim in February and market-implied rates point to additional reductions in August and November as UK growth stalls near 1 %.  ￼ ￼

Money-supply and credit gauges – bottoming out
US M2 is growing again at roughly 4 % y/y (January 2025), its highest pace since late-2022.  ￼
Haver Analytics notes that money growth is “positive and rising except for Japan,” signaling a synchronised global inflection.  ￼

S&P 500 forward returns - baseline expectations point to total returns around 8-12 % a year for the S&P 500 through 2026 – roughly 6-8 % earnings growth plus 2-4 % dividends/​buybacks – assuming valuations bleed lower but not abruptly. A repeat of 2020-21’s 20-30 % surges looks unlikely unless inflation drops faster than expected and the Fed reopens full-scale asset purchases. In short, monetary easing should be good for stocks, just not great by recent pandemic-era standards.",careyectr,90.669,9,2025-06-14 15:10:48,"['Agree with all of this, and this is driving markets up and keeping a floor on them.

Take these ratings with a grain of salt.  \nWhen buying a bond, the primary driver of the interest rate associated with it is the credit worthiness of the bond issuer (historically, the U.S. government was considered safest, but this is starting to change), the maturity, e.g. because the credit of the issuer and interest rates can change over the life of the bond, current interest rates at the time of issuance.\n\nMost bonds pay back the full principle at maturity, so unless you sell before maturity, you should not lose principal unless you sell before the bond matures or the issuer defaults. \n\nBonds typically trade at $1,000 face value.  If a bond is bid at 99 1/2, it means $995.00.  Most bonds are bought from dealers at the ask price and valued in your account at the bid price, which means you immediately have a small loss when your position is marked to the market in your brokerage account, unless you do exceptionally well timing the market.  Fear not because this small loss will come out in the wash if held to maturity.  \n\nAnother thing to keep your eye on is any call features that are described in the bond issue.  Typically, a bond issuer can buy back a bond after issuance at par or $1,000.  This can suck if rates are falling and your bond rises in value because it has a higher rate or coupon but gets called away so the issuer can refinance.', ""A bond is a promise to pay back borrowed money with a little extra as a thank-you. It's like borrowing money from a friend to buy something, agreeing to return it later with a small gift. The written promise is the bond."", 'A bond is a certificate of debt. An obligation, by the issuer, to pay the holder x amount at y date. When they are issued, the bond purchaser gives the issuer cash in exchange for the bond. The purchaser can receive value from the bond in two ways.\n\n1) the bond is sold by the issuer for less than x, so the purchaser stands to profit whatever the difference is between the purchase price and face value x.\n\n2) the bond is sold by the issuer for full cash value, and the issuer also pays interest on the bond, similar to how consumer loans work. \n\nIn either instance, the purchaser is ""guaranteed"" profit, although that guarantee is only as good as the credibility (credit rating) of the issuer. More credible issuers like the government offer lower yields on their bonds because they are safer. In essence, they have to pay less over time for money today. Less credible issuers will have to pay more over time for money today, because the value of their ""guarantee"" is lower.', 'I haven\'t seen anyone really answer how BND works for your portfolio.. all of those ""Bond etfs"" just pay a monthly dividend. BND yearly dividend is around 4% so you get 12 payments a year that will equal a roughly 4% return on your investment.\n\n  \nIf you look at long vs short bond etfs, you will see how rate changes affect their prices. EDV for example - vanguard long term bond - the price REALLY changes with rate changes. Back in 2021 it was $177 a share, now it is in the $60s. If rates go up, price goes down. That\'s because all ETF dividend payments are a constant, so if rates  for the underlying bonds in EDV go from 2% to 4% for example, and the dividend payment is $2 a year, then the price will move accordingly with the rate change. \n\nIn this example when rates are 2%, the price of EDV would be $100 a share (so the $2 yearly dividend is 2% of the price). When rates go up to 4%, the price would drop to $50/share so that the $2 in yearly dividend is now 4% of the share price.\n\n  \nShort term bond ets dont move much in price, take VUSB (vanguard ultra short bond) as an example. The price since 2021 has moved between $49-$50 and rates have been around 4% the whole time, as you\'d expect for short term bonds. I personally am holding a large amount of VUSB right now for the 4% return.', 'You Hve ChatGPT for that\n\nGrok , gemn, whatever use them', 'You borrow $1000 from a bank and pay interest of $50 for a total of $1,050. Think of that as a personal loan. \n\nNow, a company is doing the same thing by “selling debt” / issuing bonds by borrowing money from the bond holders (you). They will pay you interest as well. The bond in your account serves as the book-entry record that you’re a bond holder.\n\nDepending on the interest rate that your bond is paying and the current interest rate environment, the market value of the bond could be higher (premium) or lower (discount).  If you hold the bond until it matures, you’ll receive the par value of the bond which is essentially the # of bonds you own * $1000.', 'It’s a reverse loan.', 'Bonds are lame.

In the session, Commerce Secretary Lutnick said U.S. and Chinese talks going really well and hope end this evening. Also, U.S. and Mexico near deal to cut steel duties and cap imports. The stock market waited for result from meeting and closed higher. 🟢

🔸 Wednesday: Important key datas will be released in the next 3 day. First one was CPI inflation. It came below expectations, but it raised from 2.3% to 2.4% for annual. The meeting has ended. U.S and China completed a 'framework' and send to Trump, Xi for approval. Trump said done. The stock market opened higher. Meanwhile, Scott Bessent pointed to increase U.S. debt ceiling must be raised and extended. It could be biggest crises since 2008-09. China will add 10% tariff on U.S. products and U.S. will add 55% tariff on China products. Both of news was positive, but the stock market closed lower. The S&P 500 remained above 6,000. 🔴

🔸 Thursday: Like CPI inflation, PPI inflation came below expectations, but it raised from 2.4% to 2.5% for annual. Trump said China deal is great. U.S. Dollar Index falls below 97.5 since March 2022.

The S&P 500 closed 6,000 last week. It came nearly all-time-high value, but it struggled to reach this value. Israel-Iran conflict pulled it back to below 6,000. After the under 5,000 values, it made a strong recover. A bit correction could be healthy for the next level. The S&P5 00 has a gap between 5,820 and 5,843. I think, this points could be good enry point for new positions. On the other hand, if we could reach to 6,100 points, we can open positions there. By the way, gold is benefiting from conflicts. It may be in the portfolio. I've been keeping for a long time. It's a bit insurance. How was your week? What do you think?

There's a lot on the domestic calendar this week. But investors and the world are watching global affairs, too.

Meanwhile, several market-driving events are due in the coming days. The Federal Reserve's interest rate decision, consumer spending data, and possible news on President Donald Trump's tariffs headline the week. Thursday's Juneteenth holiday will mean a break from trading.

The Fed will hand down another decision on interest rates this week, with a decision scheduled for Wednesday. The coming weekend could see Tesla providing a significant update on the direction of the electric vehicle maker.

Did consumers in May continue to prop up the economy? Tuesday's U.S. retail sales will make it clear whether strong spending levels continued, while housing construction data will provide insight into whether builders are catching up with lagging inventory levels. Investors will continue to watch for trade developments as negotiations continue between U.S. officials and key trading partners.

It’s a light week for corporate earnings, highlighted by expected reports from homebuilder Lennar, accounting firm Accenture, grocery chain Kroger, and online used car seller CarMax.

# Fed Interest-Rate Decision Comes Amid Increasing Pressure for Cuts

Fed officials have said they are keeping rates steady amid a strong labor market as they monitor inflation data for signs that Trump’s tariffs are driving up prices.

But the pressure is on the Federal Reserve after May inflation data came in lower than economists expected. Despite comments from President Donald Trump urging the Fed to make a one-point cut, investors don't expect the central bank to take action when its two-day meeting concludes on Wednesday.

The CME FedWatch Tool, which measures fed funds futures to determine the path of interest rates, indicates that traders overwhelmingly believe that Fed will keep rates at their current levels in June. They also don't expect the central bank to move rates at its late July meeting.

After the meeting concludes on Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell will provide more insight into the central bank’s view on the economy and interest rates when he takes media questions.

On Tuesday, retail sales figures from May will provide another barometer of the economy's health Consumer spending makes up about two-thirds of the U.S. economy. Meanwhile, housing data will also be scrutinized as affordability issues continue to depress home sales. The latest homebuilder confidence reading on Tuesday will show if construction industry officials see improvements coming in the market, while Wednesday’s housing starts data will indicate whether construction levels are rising amid a need for more housing inventory.

# Tesla Robotaxi Rollout Could Come as Early as Sunday

After months of waiting, investors could soon get a key update from electric vehicle maker Tesla (TSLA). CEO Elon Musk said in a recent social media post that the company could roll out its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, as early as Sunday, June 22. ""We are being super paranoid about safety, so the date could shift,"" Musk wrote.

The introduction of the company's robotaxi service could be a key moment for Tesla, which is banking on artificial intelligence (AI) and self-driving vehicles to become the transportation technologies of the future. Tesla is well-positioned to lead the market in the emerging technology, analysts have concluded, with Goldman Sachs writing that the EV maker could have a leg up on the competition through its ability to train self-driving through its AI development and to quickly scale production levels of the technology.

Despite a light corporate earnings schedule this week, investors will still get some expected updates from noteworthy companies.

Lennar’s (LEN) expected report after the bell on Monday follows the homebuilder's warning of weakness in the housing market in the prior quarter.  The scheduled Friday reports from accounting firm Accenture (ACN) and online car seller CarMax (KMX) will be posted in the shadow of both companies' lower-than-expected profits in the prior quarter.
