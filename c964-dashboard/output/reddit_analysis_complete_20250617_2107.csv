stocks,"Sunrun -35%, SolarEdge -30%, First Solar -16% as Senate Bill Cuts Green Incentives, EV Credit Ends Early","No paywall: [https://www.investors.com/news/solar-stocks-dive-senate-bill-cuts-solar-wind-energy-incentives/?src=A00220](https://www.investors.com/news/solar-stocks-dive-senate-bill-cuts-solar-wind-energy-incentives/?src=A00220)

Solar stocks such as Sunrun (RUN), SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) and First Solar (FSLR) plunged overnight after the newly released Senate budget bill would keep a full phase-out of solar and wind energy tax credits by 2028.

The GOP-led Senate Finance Committee late Monday unveiled changes to the Trump budget bill that passed the House, but left the wind-down of solar and wind incentives.

Sunrun stock dived 35.4% early Tuesday, with SolarEdge down 30.3%, Enphase Energy (ENPH) 19.9% and First Solar stock 16.3%. Array Technologies (ARRY) gave up 13.7%, Shoals Technologies (SHLS) 10.1% and Nextracker (NXT) 13.8%. Nextera Energy (NEE) lost 2.8%.

A decline in solar and wind projects could affect demand for battery storage. But Fluence Energy (FLNC) rose 3.%.

Tesla (TSLA) has a notable storage business under Tesla Energy while the Senate bill would end the $7,500 tax credit for EVs 180 days after becoming law. That's vs. the House's end-of-2025 cut-off.

stocks,"Meta to release smart glasses with Oakley and Prada, extending Luxottica partnership","Meta and EssilorLuxottica plan to release versions of their AI-powered smart glasses under the Oakley and Prada brands, CNBC has learned.

The addition of Prada and Oakley underscore the breakout success Meta had with its second-generation Ray-Ban glasses released in partnership with Luxottica in 2023. The Oakley expansion will be done in partnership with Luxottica, while the addition of Prada signifies Meta’s first step toward bring its wearable hardware to more fashion companies. 

Meta on Monday teased the Oakley release on social media, launching an Instagram account for “Oakley | Meta” with a profile description that reads “The next evolution is coming on June 20.”

CNBC reviewed a document that says the new glasses with Luxottica will be aimed at athletes. Meta is targeting active consumers after seeing several owners of its Ray-Ban glasses use the device to record themselves playing tennis, skiing and doing other activities.

The Oakley version of the glasses may cost around $360 as they are more weather resistant than their Ray-Ban counterparts, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly about the upcoming device. The first version of the Oakley Meta glasses will feature similar technology to the Ray-Ban Meta glasses released in 2023.

Luxottica, based in France and Italy, has licensing arrangements with over 150 brands and owns notable brands including Ray-Ban, Oakley, Vogue Eyewear and Persol.

Meta’s agreement with Prada comes after the fashion company in December renewed an eyewear-related licensing agreement with Luxottica for 10 years. That deals covers the “development, production and worldwide distribution of eyewear under the Prada, Prada Linea Rossa and Miu Miu brands,” the companies said at the time.

Besides giving Meta a high-end partnership, the Prada glasses may be a particularly good fit for the tech company as many of the brand’s models come with thick temples, former Meta employees said. That provides more heft for housing many of the components necessary for smart glasses, including microphones and chips.

It’s unclear when the Prada deal and product line will be announced.

Meta first partnered with EssilorLuxottica in 2019 to jointly develop the Ray-Ban glasses. The two companies released the first version in 2021, but they found success after the release of the second-generation Ray-Ban Meta glasses in 2023. That version comes equipped with the Meta AI voice assistant and includes features and, when tethered to a smartphone, lets users identify city landmarks, get recipes when looking at ingredients and record and send voice messages on WhatsApp and Messenger.

EssilorLuxottica CEO Francesco Milleri said in February the companies have sold 2 million pairs of the Meta Ray-Ban glasses since 2023. Miller said he aimed to increase annual production to 10 million units by the end of 2026.

Meta and Luxottica announced an extension of their partnership in October, with plans to release more versions of their Ray-Ban glasses. That deal was worth $5 billion, according to a July 2024 report in The Wall Street Journal. As part of the deal, Meta gets exclusive rights to Luxottica’s brands for its smart glasses technology for a number of years, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC. 

The two companies plan to release a bulkier, third generation of their glasses in time for the coming holiday season. The new device is expected to include a small display in one of the lenses, CNBC has previously reported.

Competition in the market is heating up.

Last month, Alphabet announced a $150 million partnership with Warby Parker that will see the two companies team up to release glasses infused with Google’s Gemini AI assistant. The companies plan to release the glasses sometime after 2025. 

Snap, meanwhile, announced in June that it plans to release its sixth generation smart glasses under a new brand called Specs. Those glasses, expected for release in 2026, will include augmented-reality technology and will be smaller and lighter than Snap’s prior products, Snap said. 

Meta declined to comment. Luxottica and Prada could not be reached.

Bloomberg News first reported about the Oakley Meta glasses in January.

stocks,Eutelsat’s newly appointed CEO firmly denied that the satellite operator was in financial difficulties.,"Eutelsat’s newly appointed CEO, Jean-François Fallacher, speaking at the Paris Air Show, firmly denied that the satellite operator was in financial difficulties.

“Let me correct a misimpression: Eutelsat does not have financial difficulties: No. Eutelsat has a need for financing. There’s a difference,” Fallacher asserted. “We need financing to develop the constellation and continue our growth, which has already started and has been significant, and to conserve this unique strategic capacity.”


“We at Eutelsat provide our OneWeb network in low Earth orbit that is sovereign and European. There is a real appetite for this sovereignty across the industry,” he added.

Indeed, Fallacher emphasised that Eutelsat’s OneWeb mega-constellation is benefitting by being a valid alternate to Elon Musk’s Starlink, noting: “In the world now there are only two broadband [LEO] constellations in service: Starlink and OneWeb. What has happened in Ukraine and the recent statements of Musk, threatening a to stop work on a NASA contract, is an opportunity for us. Here we see what it means that an actor as key as that can threaten to stop service.”

Nevertheless, the need for extra financing is considerable. While there are numerous reports that Eutelsat is looking for around €1.5 billion, this might not be sufficient. It is generally accepted that replenishing the OneWeb fleet of 650 craft will cost much more that €1.5 billion. Then there’s Eutelsat’s commitment to the EU’s IRIS2 constellation which will need an additional €2 billion or so. Additionally, Eutelsat is carrying around €2.7 billion of debt.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

investing,Duolingo’s 20B+ Valuation is so Ridiculous,"I spend some time digging into Duolingo's financials - modeling out clash flows, growth rates and margins. I’m a long-time user of the app and admire the product, but as an investment, the stock seems to be way ahead of itself.

Here are some things that stood out for me in my analysis:

1. Revenue hit \~$750M in 2024 and is growing at a 40% clip.
2. Gross margins are strong at 73%.
3. EBIT margins are slime but positive -  a rarity in the ed-tech world. They are negative for Coursera and Udemy.
4. Strong brand presence gives it an edge -  Duolingo spends a little over 10% of its overall revenue on marketing, compared to Coursera and Udemy which spend over 30% to 40%

[https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ld40u0/whats\_the\_best\_investment\_options\_for\_retirement/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ld40u0/whats_the_best_investment_options_for_retirement/)

So, followup question. As my RMD from my 403b will be here soon ( I'm 71) and we are both still working with a combined annual income of 211K  with no overhead other than a 20K mortgage which will be gone in 2 years if not paid off early, it's definitely not needed. Currently around 50K in savings.

Myself, earning 91K , social security 27K, small pension from 1970 job - $2,500 ( that seemed enormous back then)

Wife 58 yrs old earning 92K  - retirement is still several years off  & maxing out 403b as well.

My 403b is currently 260K & I am maxing it out & at current projections will top 400K in several years with roughly the same math for my wife's.

So, now to the meat of the matter, If I continue to work till my wife can retire in 4-6 years, I'll still be @ my RMD in under 2 years & all it will do is increase our taxable income. I know, worse problems to have but with no deductions & always taking the short form, I REALLY will hate increasing my Fed tax contribution.

investing,Reducing overexposure in retirement portfolio,"I (51M) was looking to retire in the next 5 years but decided to retire next month. Wife (48F) plans to work for the next 5 - 10 years because she wants to; not because she has to. We can both retire today (confirmed with a CFP) if we wanted to based on our assets and spending lifestyle.

We live in Virginia. Our net worth is $6M in equities (not including $2.5M in cash, crypto and house). Majority is in retirement accounts - 401K, IRAs and HSAs. House will be paid for in 4 years. Our 2024 MAGI was around $700K but after I retire next month, 2025 MAGI will drop to around $500K. And in 2026, will drop to $400K.

Questions:
1. We are overexposed to my company stock (volatile stock) held in taxable account - 20% of our $6M. Given our MAGI and that I’m retiring, I am seeking advice on what’s the best strategy to reduce exposure and save on taxes. I’ve held majority of that company stock for over a year.

Shares of Verve Therapeutics, Inc. (VERV) rocketed 75% in pre-market on Tuesday after Eli Lilly and Company (LLY) announced its intent to acquire the company for up to $1.3 billion.

Verve is developing gene editing medicines designed to address the drivers of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), such as low-density lipoproteins, triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, and lipoprotein(a), through treatments that may only need to be given once in a lifetime.

Under the terms of the deal, Lilly will acquire all outstanding shares of Verve for $10.50 per share in cash payable at closing, in addition to a contingent value right (CVR) per share that entitles holders to $3 per share, subject to the completion of certain milestones. The aggregate value of the deal is approximately $1.3 billion.

With large-cap names like LLY making bold moves in gene editing, stocks like CRSP, NTLA, BEAM, BGM, ARWR, and EXEL could see renewed attention as investors look for broader exposure across the precision medicine space.

The upfront purchase price of $10.50 represents a premium of over 67% to Verve’s closing price on Monday.

The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter, subject to customary closing conditions.",Less_Dependent416,103.85499999999999,0,2025-06-17 19:01:12,[],https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1le1m8c/verve_therapeutics_stock_rockets_75_premarket/,[],positive,113.9,neutral,50.0,[],positive,103.85499999999999,0

Okay... But there\'s a limit there. That\'s not sound fundamental investing.\n\nIf tip fees aren\'t enough to cover the expensive cost of mining (electricity, hardware, rent, air conditioning, wages) in an already tight-margin operation, miners leave the network, reducing its security.\n\nThe issue here is that the network becomes susceptible to being hacked. Whales can buy mining hardware, attack the network. ""oh but then they just fork the chain"". Ok. Sure. But the attacker still has the hardware and they can indefinitely ""spawn camp"" your new forks.

And the bitcoin community is mega cultish and would never allow such an adjustment to chain. They would let it burn before making such adjustments.\n\nNow, Ethereum on the other hand has switched to proof of stake which reducing hardware and energy cost by over 99%, has introduced an issuance balancing mechanism to ensure stalkers always earn their keep in reward for network security (Eip-1559).

Solar stocks such as Sunrun (RUN), SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) and First Solar (FSLR) plunged overnight after the newly released Senate budget bill would keep a full phase-out of solar and wind energy tax credits by 2028.

The GOP-led Senate Finance Committee late Monday unveiled changes to the Trump budget bill that passed the House, but left the wind-down of solar and wind incentives.

Sunrun stock dived 35.4% early Tuesday, with SolarEdge down 30.3%, Enphase Energy (ENPH) 19.9% and First Solar stock 16.3%. Array Technologies (ARRY) gave up 13.7%, Shoals Technologies (SHLS) 10.1% and Nextracker (NXT) 13.8%. Nextera Energy (NEE) lost 2.8%.

A decline in solar and wind projects could affect demand for battery storage. But Fluence Energy (FLNC) rose 3.%.

Tesla (TSLA) has a notable storage business under Tesla Energy while the Senate bill would end the $7,500 tax credit for EVs 180 days after becoming law. That's vs. the House's end-of-2025 cut-off.

A prolonged Israel-Iran conflict could pressure the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates sooner than expected, as rising oil prices may hurt economic growth more than inflation.

Solar stocks such as Sunrun (RUN), SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) and First Solar (FSLR) plunged overnight after the newly released Senate budget bill would keep a full phase-out of solar and wind energy tax credits by 2028.

The GOP-led Senate Finance Committee late Monday unveiled changes to the Trump budget bill that passed the House, but left the wind-down of solar and wind incentives.

Sunrun stock dived 35.4% early Tuesday, with SolarEdge down 30.3%, Enphase Energy (ENPH) 19.9% and First Solar stock 16.3%. Array Technologies (ARRY) gave up 13.7%, Shoals Technologies (SHLS) 10.1% and Nextracker (NXT) 13.8%. Nextera Energy (NEE) lost 2.8%.

A decline in solar and wind projects could affect demand for battery storage. But Fluence Energy (FLNC) rose 3.%.

Tesla (TSLA) has a notable storage business under Tesla Energy while the Senate bill would end the $7,500 tax credit for EVs 180 days after becoming law. That's vs. the House's end-of-2025 cut-off.

StockMarket,If Tesla were to crash at least 50 percent on a random week by year end 2025,"If Tesla were to crash 50% by year-end, on a single trading day or single trading week; particularly following weak Q2 earnings, the broader impact on the market, especially the S&P 500 (SPY) and the NYSE would be noticeable, though not necessarily catastrophic. The selloff would likely be triggered by disappointing financials, such as shrinking profit margins, slower-than-expected EV demand, Cybertruck delays, or underperformance in Tesla’s energy and Robotics taxi project. As hype around autonomy and robotics fades and investors refocus on core business fundamentals, sentiment could turn sharply negative.

Given Tesla’s position as a top and liquid holding in the S&P 500, a 50% drop could wipe out over $400 billion in market capitalization, dragging SPY lower by around 1%. More important than the direct index weighting, however, would be the psychological impact on markets, especially on other high-growth, high-valuation tech stocks. Investor appetite for speculative names could decline rapidly, sparking a broader correction in the Nasdaq and tech-heavy ETFs.

The NYSE, while less dependent on Tesla, could still feel the effects through a shift in investor sentiment from high premium/ high P/B and PER valuation to discount valuations on nearly all sectors.

Because Tesla is one of the most actively traded and optioned stocks, a sudden collapse would also trigger volatility in the derivatives market. This could lead to forced deleveraging among funds, margin calls, and potentially sharp intraday moves in broader indices. If markets begin to view Tesla’s decline as a symptom of broader economic awakening , expectations around Federal Reserve policy could also shift, with traders pricing in earlier rate cuts to support a potentially softening economy.

In short, Tesla’s collapse would likely cause the S&P 500 to drop modestly in direct terms but could spark a wider tech correction and a meaningful tightening of market sentiment. The systemic risk would be limited, but the psychological and liquidity impacts could extend far beyond Tesla itself.
