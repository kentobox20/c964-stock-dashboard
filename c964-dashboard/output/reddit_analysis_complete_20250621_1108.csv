4.  AR/AI: Saturn could leverage Snap’s AR and AI for interactive scheduling, keeping teens hooked.

BCP Portugal Commercial Bank was the standout +3.6% pushing the index higher alongside Semapa and EDPR. Overall 19 stocks closed up, only 6 down, so broadbased strength for sure.

But then there GALP the perennial hot topic. The energy giant slid 1.6% on the day despite all the buzz about its undervalued status.

stocks,Aebi Schmidt merger with The Shyft Group (SHYF),"In December 2024, Swiss based Aebi Schmidt and US based The Shyft Group (SHYF) announced a planned merger, which would result is an all stock acquisition of SHYF by Aebi Schmidt.  The merged company will be listed on the NASDAQ under AEBI.  
  
Under the terms of the merger, SHYF shareholders will receive 1.04 shares of AEBI for each of their current shares.  They will own 48% of the new company, while AEBI stakeholders will own 52%.
  
This week SHYF shareholders did vote to approve the merger and the deal is set to close on or near July 1st.  The latest pro forma figures estimates for 2025 are:  
* Revenue of $2.2b 
* EBITDA of $214m (~10% margin)
* Post merger total debt $498m  
  
The 2024 pro forma numbers were:
* Revenue of $1.87b
* EBITDA of $148m
* Net Debt of $374m

Between 15% to 20% of the 2025 EBITDA growth is expected to be generated from realized run-rate synergies (annualized).  The 3 year strategic plan after 2025 is forecasted to grow the company to $3b in revenue with mid-teen EBITDA margins.  That growth in margin is predicated on continued cost reductions through the growth of operational efficiencies.

investing,Thoughts on this Allocation?,"Thoughts on this allocation?

Hopefully retiring in 30-40 years.

DOMESTIC:
- 60% | SPTM - TOTAL US MARKET

- 5% | CLOZ - US BBB SENIOR CORP LOANS

- 5% | UTES - AMERICAN UTILITIES
- 5% | XAR - AMERICAN AEROSPACE & DEFENSE

INTERNATIONAL:
- 10% | AVDE - INTL EX-US EQUITY

- 5% | FSCO - INTL FIXED INCOME

- 5% | QTUM - INTL MACHINE LEARNING

I have UTES/XAR/QTUM/FTWO as my tinkering/fun part of the portfolio, also somewhat of a defensive core against market crash. Should I get rid of this and simply reallocate to total market funds for long term growth?

I have CLOZ/FSCO as purely a safety net of capital preservation & compounding dividends. I currently have about 140 shares of both which nets me 1 share of each fund every month.

I feel like I have the basis of what I want to invest in listed, but I also feel like it may be too complicated to keep in balance.

The 1/16/26 calls are harder to predict because there's a chance of GOOG falling down after a period of time, and if it starts declining after 8/15, then chances are those contracts are not going to convert.\n\nThe issue is that volatility remains elevated, so the price of the contracts can drop even if the stock rises. It would be safer to stick closer to ATM or ATM for the strike price. \n\n  \nFor reference, I have -2 GOOG 7/25/25 185P contracts. I'm expecting GOOG to soar after today's large decline. Maybe not on Monday, but I'm expecting for it to climb back up. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pkq03gskq68f1.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b5ebdc0084eb20327d68907b77307baab0174ed"", 'I bought 15 225C 1/2026 in early January with a cost basis around $9.50.

SecurityAnalysis,I wrote an investing book back in 2023. You can buy it or get it free if you sub to my newsletter.,"Hey all,

In 2011, I started as an  
investment analyst at a 10-billion-dollar hedge fund in Latin America. After I  
left that role for a corporate finance role, I started sharing my investment  
ideas on Seeking Alpha almost 10 years ago. Over the years, I kept a Google Doc  
with my investment checklist, that list has been evolving over the years and in  
2022, a friend told me, ""Hey, you have book material."" So I wrote the  
book and published it in 2023.

The book is The Most Boring Stock Investment Book You’ll Ever  
*Read*. The name’s not a joke as  
there are no trading hacks, no chart voodoo, no “next big thing.” Just a full  
breakdown of how I approach investing: how to evaluate management, ROIC,  
catalysts, margin of safety, and how to model out a company from scratch.

It includes detailed case  
studies (some big winners, some flops), and it’s really my entire framework in  
one place. No secrets held back.

The strategy in the book  
has allowed me to beat the S&P for more than a decade.

If you want to check it  
out, it’s on Amazon. But I also send it for free to new subscribers of my  
newsletter (*Beating The Tide*), where I now share live portfolio moves and  
monthly trade ideas based on the same system. Just putting it out there in case  
it’s helpful to anyone looking for something grounded and process-driven.

StockMarket,US Supreme Court declines to speed up decision on taking up fight over Trump tariffs,"No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-leading-indicators-slip-may-180818431.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-leading-indicators-slip-may-180818431.html)

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Supreme Court declined on Friday to speed up its consideration of whether to take up a challenge to President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs even before lower courts have ruled in the dispute.

The Supreme Court denied a request by a family-owned toy company, Learning Resources, that filed the legal challenge against Trump's tariffs to expedite the review of the dispute by the nation's top judicial body.

The company, which makes educational toys, won a court ruling on May 29 that Trump cannot unilaterally impose tariffs using the emergency legal authority he had cited for them. That ruling is currently on hold, leaving the tariffs in place for now.

Learning Resources asked the Supreme Court to take the rare step of immediately hearing the case to decide the legality of the tariffs, effectively leapfrogging the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in Washington, where the case is pending.

Two district courts have ruled that Trump's tariffs are not justified under the law he cited for them, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Both of those cases are on appeal.

StockMarket,Navitas Semiconductor : Big hate ??,"Hi everyone,

Sorry, my english is bad, i'm french.

I bought some navitas semicondutor after the nvidia partnership announcement. Of course, i was late and i got a very high price (7,97 per stock, fees and change inclued). Of course, like everytime i bought a stock, the stock drops like a stone. The last one was Genesis mineral : 10% loss.  I can't enjoy 3-4% after buying, my life is too bad to get this kind of little hapiness.

So i try to understand why the stock drop like that. Because every article i read about the nvidia partnership, everyone was OK to say this is a big pump for revenues. But, since, i've read only very negative article about Navitas Semiconductor, like ""the partnership is not very clear"" ""option is very low"" "" it's just an overhype"" ""the company is bad because they are dependant of china, so tariff will kill it""

Today, honestly, i don't know what i should think. I read the same shit about Coreweave ... So i hesitate to sell. Everyone knows July will be on fire about economic context : Big beautififul one at the Senate, the return of Tariff for Europe and South Asia (no agreement for the moment and the last news say no progression). So like before the liberation day, i will sell all my green position to save what i can. 

So it's hard for me to keep navitas at 7,9. Because this is the typical stock which drops very hard in this case of bad news ...

What do you think ?
