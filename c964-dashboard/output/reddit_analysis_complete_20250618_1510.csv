stocks,"Waymo cars are coming to New York, but with a driver behind the wheel","Residents of New York City will soon start seeing Waymo cars cruising the avenues. But at least for now, a human will be in the driver‚Äôs seat.

Alphabet‚Äôs self-driving car unit announced on Wednesday that it plans to drive vehicles manually in New York, marking the first step toward potentially cracking the largest U.S. city. Waymo said it applied for a permit with the New York City Department of Transportation to operate autonomously with a trained specialist behind the wheel in Manhattan.

‚ÄúWhile we won‚Äôt be in New York full-time yet, we have every intention of bringing our fully autonomous ride-hailing service to the city in the future,‚Äù the company said in an announcement. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre working towards that goal in a few key ways.‚Äù

If the permit is granted, it would be the city‚Äôs first testing deployment of autonomous vehicles.¬†New York state law currently prohibits a service like Waymo to operate without a driver.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre advocating for a change in state law that would allow for operating a vehicle with no human behind the wheel,‚Äù the company said.

Meanwhile, Waymo is aggressively expanding into new U.S. markets. Waymo One, its ride-hailing service, provides more than 250,000 paid trips each week across Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Austin, Texas, and is preparing to bring fully autonomous rides to Atlanta, Miami, and Washington, D.C., in 2026.

Waymo has made a prior appearance in New York.

The company brought its cars to¬†parts¬†of the city in 2021 for manual driving, data collection and testing. Ethan Teicher, a Waymo spokesperson, said ‚Äúit was a planned trip with a start and an end.‚Äù The testing allowed Waymo to improve driving in icy and snowy conditions in a densely populated area, the company said.

The Waymo got confused and was constantly backing up, pulling forward, backing up, trying to go around, etc. but we were stuck and the dude wouldn‚Äôt move. We had to call support from inside the vehicle and I‚Äôm assuming someone remote had to manually back up our car to get us out of the alleyway. The person pulled out in the middle of the street to do so, and then it took about 15 seconds to give control back to the car. \n\nAnyway, it seems the major drawback for Waymo at this time is not having a person in control to get out of different situations. The lidar can only do so much and it‚Äôll be interesting to see if that improves. We took Ubers the rest of the time after that, since they‚Äôre cheaper.

* US regulators are considering changes to a key capital rule for major banks
* The U.S. central bank announced the board meeting, scheduled for June 25, to discuss changes to the so-called ""supplementary leverage ratio,"" which requires banks to set aside capital against assets regardless of their risk.e Federal Reserve, FDIC, and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency are reviewing adjustments to the¬†enhanced supplementary leverage ratio that applies to the largest U.S. banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley.
* Under the proposal, the capital requirement for bank holding companies could be reduced to a range of 3.5% to 4.5%, down from the current 5%. The banks' operating subsidiaries would likely see their requirements fall to the same range, compared to the existing 6%.
* Banks say the current requirements are excessive and poorly calibrated, and some of that cash could better serve the economy by being lent out.
* They point to how big banks weathered the COVID-19 pandemic and their role in stabilizing regional banks during turmoil in 2023 as proof that they are resilient and do not need to tolerate more onerous rules.
* Among the industry's goals are to lock in a much weaker version of¬†the ""Basel Endgame"" capital rule[,](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/what-is-basel-iii-endgame-why-are-banks-worked-up-about-it-2023-07-24/)¬†reduce a capital surcharge levied on global banks, re-work a key leverage constraint, and overhaul the Federal Reserve's annual ""stress tests"" which assess whether a bank could withstand an economic shock, said three executives with knowledge of the ambitious lobbying plan.

AAPL has been relatively weak so far in 2025. As of June 17, shares were trading at $195.64, down $2.83 intraday (-1.43%) Cumulatively, the year-to-date decline is about 20%, making it one of the worst-performing tech giants in MAG7

If AAPL falls to $193-190, you can consider taking small positions to buy in low batches and take advantage of the SMA support area for short-term rebound arbitrage.

Shares of Verve Therapeutics, Inc. (VERV) rocketed 75% in pre-market on Tuesday after Eli Lilly and Company (LLY) announced its intent to acquire the company for up to $1.3 billion.

Verve is developing gene editing medicines designed to address the drivers of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), such as low-density lipoproteins, triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, and lipoprotein(a), through treatments that may only need to be given once in a lifetime.

Under the terms of the deal, Lilly will acquire all outstanding shares of Verve for $10.50 per share in cash payable at closing, in addition to a contingent value right (CVR) per share that entitles holders to $3 per share, subject to the completion of certain milestones. The aggregate value of the deal is approximately $1.3 billion.

With large-cap names like LLY making bold moves in gene editing, stocks like CRSP, NTLA, BEAM, BGM, ARWR, and EXEL could see renewed attention as investors look for broader exposure across the precision medicine space.

The upfront purchase price of $10.50 represents a premium of over 67% to Verve‚Äôs closing price on Monday.

The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter, subject to customary closing conditions.",Less_Dependent416,103.85499999999999,0,2025-06-17 19:01:12,[],https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1le1m8c/verve_therapeutics_stock_rockets_75_premarket/,[],positive,113.9,neutral,50.0,[],positive,103.85499999999999,0

Or do you just diversify enough to hedge against a few stocks losing the bulk of their value at some point in the long-term? Or do you just assume that you‚Äôll sell a stock before the downturn, eat the CG tax, and move it into another stock with a solid 5-10 year outlook? 

P.S. this is specifically regarding individual stocks, not ETFs or mutual funds.",UuuBetcha,40.9825,10,2025-06-18 10:56:00,"['It‚Äôs an impossible thing to know.

I have a couple of stocks that have done poorly, so I can do some tax loss harvesting reducing my LTCGs with sales from those stocks.  If the long term outlook for a holding turns negative, I‚Äôll probably sell.  I have a few like BA that I hope will recover.  \n\nOne other factor is that should I pass away, my heirs would benefit from a step up in cost basis on these stocks, thereby eliminating CGs should they sell immediately or reducing them, should they continue to hold these stocks and sell at a later date.', 'This is why owning single stocks aren‚Äôt a great idea.

Studies show that only the top 4% of companies account for most of the overall market gains annually. Studies also show that passive index funds have a higher expected return than active portfolio management. AKA there‚Äôs no logical reason to actively manage a portfolio, or even invest in professionally managed active funds, if your goal is to ‚Äúmake money‚Äù long term when passive funds are easily accessible nowadays. \n\nStudies also show that 99% of individuals stocks don‚Äôt even beat treasury bills long term, and ~50% of public companies in 1996 have either gone bankrupt or delisted due to corporate failure. Don‚Äôt believe me? Read Bessembinder‚Äôs recent study on individual stocks vs. t-bills.\n\nPlus, with low-fee passive funds like VT, you outsource portfolio management to Vanguard for pennies.

US battery manufacturers are facing serious challenges after China banned antimony exports to the U.S., escalating a supply crisis that some now consider a national emergency. China, which provides over half of the world‚Äôs antimony and controls most processing facilities, imposed restrictions last summer and fully banned exports in December 2024 in response to U.S. chip sanctions. Antimony, vital for lead-acid batteries and military gear like night vision goggles and flares, is classified as critical to U.S. national security. Prices have surged, and supply is tight.

StockMarket,Opinion: May‚Äôs missing inflation is a mystery ‚Äî and a sign that the Fed will hold off on rate cuts,,ChiGuy6124,19.565500000000004,14,2025-06-18 08:28:16,"['Inflation is still here.\n\nI dont care what the govt says. My bills are going up every few months.', '*I think this is a good analysis but it is missing the possibility of a ""shadow"" Fed chairman appointed by Trump which could throw everything out the window and create chaos.*\n\n""A lot of things went right for U.S. inflation in May. The consumer-price index rose just 0.1% from April, and held under 2.5% in year-over-year terms for a third consecutive month. Some of the most volatile prices that consumers pay dropped, with both gasoline and eggs down more than 2% from April. The stickiest prices helped, too: Rent of primary residence registered its smallest increase since 2021, as housing inflation is finally getting back to normal.""\n\n""More surprising in the May data was an absence of inflation in categories that seemed likely to be lifted by U.S. tariffs. New-vehicle prices fell 0.3%, while used cars and trucks fell 0.5%. Consumers scrambled to buy cars in March and April before pretariff inventory vanished from dealer lots, and inventories on dealer lots are leaner than a year ago ‚Äî it‚Äôs a surprise that didn‚Äôt allow dealers to hike prices. Apparel prices also fell on the month and on the year, even though most clothing Americans buy is imported and subject to tariffs. Lower prices in these categories helped hold core inflation at the lowest since 2021 for a third month running.""\n\n""The mystery of May‚Äôs missing inflation is partly explained by a surge in imports in the first quarter, which sent the U.S. trade deficit surging to a record high. Retailers and manufacturers scrambled to build inventory ahead of the tariff hikes. That provided breathing room for them to wait for clarity on tariffs before deciding how much (or whether) to raise prices in reaction.""\n\n""Weak consumer demand could be another, more concerning explanation for May‚Äôs missing inflation. Consumer confidence plunged during April‚Äôs tariff shock and stock-market selloff. It‚Äôs stabilized since, but there are still plenty of signs that discretionary consumer spending is skittish: suspended earnings guidance from airlines, falling TSA checkpoint traffic, and weaker spending on restaurants and other discretionary services reported by business surveys and the Federal Reserve‚Äôs Beige Book. New-car sales stepped back nearly 10% from April to May. The May CPI report‚Äôs lower prices in discretionary categories ‚Äî autos, clothing, airfares and hotels ‚Äî could mean that businesses ceded margin to hit sales targets.""\n\n""Despite ample evidence of higher inflation ahead, financial markets continue to price in hopes that the Fed will cut interest rates in the second half of the year ‚Äî perhaps because the job market will weaken and force the Fed‚Äôs hand? If that‚Äôs the reason, the market will probably be disappointed again by the Fed holding its policy rate higher for longer. Job growth has been slower so far in 2025 than in 2024, but fewer new jobs are needed to hold the unemployment rate steady this year, since tighter immigration policy is slowing growth of the labor force.""\n\n""And the Fed will be less willing to bet that tariff-fueled price increases will be just ‚Äútransitory‚Äù after misjudging the inflation surge between 2021 and 2023. The Fed is nearly a lock to hold rates steady in its next couple of decisions, and more likely than not will keep the federal-funds target rate at its current level through the end of 2025.""', 'Inflation is so difficult to predict.

StockMarket,"The rally is ""still hated""","(market analysis and expectations)

[‚Ä¶]

Data from market research firms SentimenTrader, Ned Davis Research, and Vanda, cited by Charles Schwab, show that equity exposure remains below historical averages, with mutual funds, hedge funds, and retail traders slowly rebuilding their risk positions.

That caution was echoed in Bank of America‚Äôs latest Global Fund Manager Survey released Tuesday, which showed a sharp drop in risk appetite with a net 28% of investors taking a more-cautious-than-normal level of risk in their portfolios.

The survey also revealed that equity allocations remain well below average, currently sitting one standard deviation below their long-term norm.

However, that caution, some strategists argue, may be more of a tailwind than a headwind for stocks.

But The Federal reserve  held interest rates steady on Wednesday, keeping its benchmark rate in the 5.25%‚Äì5.50% range, where it has remained since July 2023. While acknowledging that inflation remains elevated and economic growth is likely to slow, the Fed still signaled that two rate cuts are expected later this year. This decision aligned with market expectations, which had priced in no change in rates for this meeting. The central bank remains cautious, balancing persistent inflation pressures with a weakening economic outlook.
