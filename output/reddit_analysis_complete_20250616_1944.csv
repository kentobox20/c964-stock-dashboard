stocks,Trump threatens to set unilateral tariff rates within 2 weeks,"Unilateral ‚Äútake it or leave it‚Äù tariffs in 1-2 weeks
Trump announced he'll mail formal letters to dozens of trading partners (roughly 15 key countries like Japan, South Korea, EU, Canada, Mexico) within the next week or two, demanding acceptance of new tariff terms or else face punitive tariffs

The plan builds on a universal 10% baseline tariff and steep reciprocal tariffs for specific countries

Legal backing secured - temporarily - after an appeals court ruling allow these tariffs to stay in effect for at least two more months

The regime is shifting from broad multilateral deals to one-on-one negotiations, with the EU expected to be the toughest and last to be resolved

Futures are looking surprisingly strong today, despite high geopolitical tensions and the spark reality that tariffs will not be going away any time soon. 

Expect a lot of volatility over the coming days as key economic reports are coming out and tariff news is drip fed too.

VIX is one to watch as usual now.

(Reuters) -Brussels negotiators hope that offering to accept U.S. tariffs of 10% across all of the European Union's exports into the United States will avert any higher duties on cars, drugs and electronics, newspaper Handelsblatt reported on Monday.

Citing high-ranking EU negotiators, the paper said the offer to U.S. counterparts would come only under certain conditions and would not be billed as permanent.

Handelsblatt also said the EU was, in return, ready to cut its tariffs on US-made vehicles, and to possibly change technical or legal hurdles to make it easier for US manufacturers to sell their cars in Europe.

The EU has also offered to completely ban purchases of Russian natural gas, potentially creating more demand for US producers.

The EU Commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The EU's position comes partly from the realisation that President Donald Trump will rely on some tariff revenues to fund planned tax cuts.

US negotiators, however, have so far not agreed to limit their import duties on EU cars to 10%, the paper added.",callsonreddit,86.04799999999999,38,2025-06-16 07:41:21,"['Hi, you\'re on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you\'re interested in just politics, see our wiki on [""relevant subreddits""](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index/#wiki_relevant_subreddits) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

stocks,Oil prices jump more than 3% as Israel strikes Iran energy facilities,"Crude oil futures jumped more than 3% Sunday after Israel struck two natural gas facilities in Iran, raising fears that the war will expand to energy infrastructure and disrupt supplies in the region. U.S. crude¬†oil rose $2.72, or 3.7%, to $75.67 per barrel. Global benchmark¬†Brent¬†was up $3.67, or 4.94%, at $77.90 per barrel.

Israeli unmanned aerial vehicles struck the South Pars gas field in southern Iran on Saturday, according to Iranian¬†state media¬†reports. The strikes hit two natural gas processing facilities, according to¬†state media. It is unclear how much damage was done to the facilities. South Pars is one of the largest natural gas fields in the world. Israel also hit a major oil depot near Tehran, sources told¬†The Jerusalem Post. Iranian missiles, meanwhile, damaged a major oil refinery in Haifa, according to¬†The Times of Israel.

Oil prices¬†closed more than 7% higher¬†Friday, after Israel launched a wave of airstrikes against Iran‚Äôs nuclear and ballistic missile programs as well as its senior military leadership. It was the biggest single-day move for the oil market since March 2022 after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. U.S. crude oil jumped 13% in total last week.

If someone has a genuine catalyst in mind at how the laggards can become the leader, fine but buying lesser names in a theme simply because they appear cheaper often leads to it becoming obvious that they were cheaper for a reason.\n\n""mostly because I‚Äôm worried about buying in too high""\n\nObviously, optimally one wants to buy low but I think it\'s also just easier. Someone who bought NVDA at the top in 2021 around $60\'s did extremely well ... if they held through a nearly 70% decline to the bottom in 2022. Say someone bought it at the bottom only around 18 months earlier in March 2020 in the low single digits, the decline in 21/22 was horrid but they never saw their position go below the cost basis. Two people who bought within 18 months of each other who would have done very well if they held today but I think it was at least a mildly easier hold for the person with the better cost basis. An extreme example would be something like people buying MSFT at the top in the dot com era - *eventually* you did well, but it took more than a decade.\n\nHow much more likely is the person who bought NVDA November 2021 at the top to sell in the 2021/2022 decline than the person who bought in March 2020 is? I dunno, maybe just me but I do think that there is something to the idea of really buying great companies in a March 2020 or April 2025 and just owning them - where you bought does matter. Buying things during periods like April or March 2020 is difficult but it often can make a long time after easier.  \n\nI own a bunch of various plays on the AI theme, but they were bought lower or much lower. I\'ve owned NVDA for a number of years - the cost basis is such that the company would have to be in financial distress to get back there. I sold some NVDA last year and said I was keeping the rest with the belief that the stock would be higher in 5 years but I would be surprised if there wasn\'t a significant correction between then and 5 years. You got a nearly 40% correction this year from top to bottom; not as much as I thought but pretty sizable.\n\nI can see AI doing well over the long-term, but you\'re going to have other March/April 2025\'s between now and then. In 2020, it was ""stocks only go up"" and ""this time is different"" and then all the growth names cratered in 2022. In 2023/24 it was ""stocks only go up"" again until 2025. ""Escalator up"" for an extended period of time and everyone gets complacent then ""elevator down."" You have a market post-covid that increasingly seems only interested in the hot things, piles into them much faster than ever and they get overcrowded faster then ever - something happens (2022, 2025) and everyone heads for the hills...then eventually wanders back. Wash, rinse, repeat. \n\nMaybe if you get a down day or two buy a *little* bit of AI (but really, unless you have a thesis for why things will change with lesser companies, stick with quality) and that may lessen the FOMO. Create a shopping list of the names you want, reasonable price points where you\'d like to buy and gradually build positions over the coming months. Have a reasonable allocation to a theme, don\'t turn your entire portfolio into that theme or become heavily reliant upon that theme doing well or not meaning you have a good day/week/month with your portfolio. Be patient, wait for good opportunities. If it doesn\'t feel good to be buying something (March 2020, April 2025) that\'s often the buys that are fantastic months/years later. If everything feels too easy then that\'s when you should get at least a little concerned.', 'Most of the answers are really short sighted in my opinion.

stocks,Cathie Wood Just Bought Millions in Archer Aviation,"June 14 Ark Invest's Cathie Wood bought a large stake in Archer Aviation (NYSE:ACHR) after the stock slid nearly 15% Friday on a fresh equity sale.

According to recent news, Wood added about $40 million worth of ACHR shares across three of her exchange-traded funds. The Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) led the move with over 2.8 million shares, while Ark Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (ARKQ) and Ark Space Exploration & Innovation ETF (ARKX) picked up smaller amounts.


The buying spree followed Archer's announcement of an $850 million direct stock offering priced at $10 per share. Investors reacted to the dilution risk, sending shares lower.

Archer, which builds electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, has laid out bold plans to launch air taxi services ahead of the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.

Separately, Wood's funds cut exposure to the defense sector, selling nearly $2 million worth of Kratos Defense & Security Solutions (NASDAQ:KTOS) stock.

The recent executive order from former President Donald Trump, aimed at fast-tracking eVTOL integration, could create tailwinds for companies like Archer.

President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Monday that they are signing a trade deal that will slash tariffs on goods from both countries.

The deal does not include tariffs on steel, an especially important piece of bilateral trade. Instead, talks are still going on about whether steel tariffs will be cut to zero as planned in the provisional agreement.

Trump and Starmer announced in May they‚Äôd struck an agreement that would slash U.S. import taxes on British cars, steel and aluminum in return for greater access to the British market for U.S. products including beef and ethanol.

But it did not immediately take effect, leaving British businesses uncertain about whether the U.K. could be exposed to any surprise hikes from Trump.

British businesses, and the U.K. government, were blindsided earlier this month when Trump doubled metals tariffs on countries around the world to 50%. He later clarified the level would remain at 25% for the U.K.

Starmer said Monday that the trade agreement is ‚Äúin the final stages now of implementation, and I expect that to be completed very soon.‚Äù

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares popped nearly 10% to lead S&P 500 gainers Monday as Piper Sandler analysts raised their price target for the stock coming out of the chipmaker's ""Advancing AI"" event. 

Piper raised its target to $140 from $125 and maintained an ""overweight"" rating for AMD stock. Shares of AMD were at about $127 in recent trading, making Piper's target a roughly 10% premium. 

The analysts came away ""enthused"" by the firm's newly unveiled Helios server rack architecture, which it called ""pivotal"" for the growth of AMD Instinct GPUs. Helios will combine next-generation AMD MI400 chips into one larger system, the company said, and is expected in 2026. 

AMD highlighted its partnerships with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Meta Platforms (META), Oracle (ORCL), Microsoft (MSFT), and others at the event. Bank of America analysts believe there‚Äôs another high-profile partner announcement to come: Amazon (AMZN).

Amazon Web Services (AWS) was ""a key sponsor for the event,"" BofA said. However, AWS typically uses its own events to announce new engagements, making a future reveal likely, the bank added.

U.S. households to keep buying stocks this year, Goldman Sachs says

Jun 16, 2025

U.S. households are expected to remain major buyers of equities in 2025, according to a note from Goldman Sachs, which estimates they will purchase $425 billion in stocks this year, second only to corporates at $675 billion.

‚ÄúThe resilience of household demand for equities is vital,‚Äù the analysts said, noting that households ‚Äúdirectly own 38% of the U.S. equity market and control an even larger share including indirect ownership through funds.‚Äù¬†

That demand is said to have persisted even as Goldman‚Äôs Sentiment Indicator ‚Äúregisters -1.2 this week, remaining in negative territory despite a 21% rally in the S&P 500 from its April trough.‚Äù

Retail trading activity also remains robust, according to the bank.¬†

‚ÄúGoldman Sachs trading desk estimates of flows from retail trading activity suggests close to $20 billion of net buying during the past three months,‚Äù the note said.

Goldman attributes this sustained buying to a favourable macro backdrop. ‚ÄúThe typical macro drivers of equity flows suggest households will keep buying this year,‚Äù with outflows generally linked to ‚Äúweakening household balance sheets, rising unemployment, and increasing interest rates,‚Äù none of which are dominant now.

The bank added that the equity exposure of U.S. households has reached historic levels.¬†

‚ÄúHouseholds allocate 49% of their total financial assets to equities, the highest level on record,‚Äù slightly surpassing the previous peak in 2000. In contrast, households in Japan and the Euro Area allocate only 13% and 10%, respectively.

Retirement savings continue to play a key role. ‚ÄúWe estimate contributions to 401(k) plans drive roughly $500 billion of annual equity demand,‚Äù Goldman said, noting the average equity allocation in those plans has increased from 66% in 2013 to 71% in 2022.",ManekenkaDaBudem,85.1645,17,2025-06-16 08:06:56,"['I mean yeah. 401ks on auto make it unlikely that would stop', ""I can't speak for all retail, but for me, it has never been easier to invest in the stock market, and its also cheaper than ever.

stocks,"WhatsApp to Show Ads, Offer Paid Subscriptions for First Time","Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. will begin showing ads inside of its WhatsApp messaging service, opening a new potential revenue stream while the company invests heavily in artificial intelligence and other long-term projects. 

The ads will appear in WhatsApp‚Äôs ‚ÄúUpdates‚Äù tab, a section of the app that‚Äôs separate from a user‚Äôs inbox and private conversations. The tab gets 1.5 billion visitors per day, Meta said Monday. That tab is home to Status, WhatsApp‚Äôs version of disappearing Stories, which will now carry ads.

Advertisers can also pay to promote their WhatsApp Channel and give it prominent placement within the Updates tab. Channels allow brands or celebrities to post to a group of followers, like a giant email blast. 

As part of the advertising push, WhatsApp will also let Channel operators sell subscriptions, meaning they can create special messages just for a group of paying customers. Meta won‚Äôt take a cut of any subscriptions sold through the app at launch, but eventually plans to charge 10% of sales, Alice Newton Rex, vice president of product at WhatsApp, said in an interview. 

Meta has been spending aggressively this year on AI, including to improve the large language models that underpin generative AI features in its products. The company also just agreed to invest $14.3 billion for a 49% stake in Scale AI, an AI data labeling startup, according to a person familiar with the deal. The expense has added pressure on Meta‚Äôs main advertising business to continue growing to support the expanding AI effort. 

The company has spent years slowly developing a business to accompany the private messaging service acquired for $19 billion in 2014. Advertising has never been considered a great fit given the intimacy of a private messaging inbox. Meta instead built WhatsApp to cater to small businesses, including efforts to build out digital payments and shopping features. Those services have been targeted especially in countries outside the US, such as India and Brazil, where the WhatsApp is the dominant messaging app. 

While payments, in particular, has been a slow moving effort given various regulatory concerns, Meta makes billions of dollars each year selling click-to-message ads on Instagram and Facebook that send users to a WhatsApp chat conversation with the advertiser. It also allows businesses to pay to reach customers on the app who have opted to receive their direct messages. 

Part of Meta‚Äôs challenge historically has been balancing the desire to generate revenue with a desire to give WhatsApp users privacy. Meta‚Äôs other advertising products are hyper-targeted and often rely on a user‚Äôs personal information or browsing history. WhatsApp messages are end-to-end encrypted, and user privacy was a major promise from co-founders Jan Koum and Brian Acton, who pledged they would never sell ads inside WhatsApp. They left Meta in 2018 and 2017, respectively.

WhatsApp ads will use broad, general targeting like a user‚Äôs location, language preferences, and Channels that they follow, Newton Rex said. Meta won‚Äôt take a person‚Äôs Facebook or Instagram information to target them with ads on WhatsApp unless they‚Äôve explicitly linked their accounts, she added. 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to interrupt people‚Äôs personal messages with ads,‚Äù Newton Rex said. ‚ÄúIf you just want to carry on using WhatsApp for messaging and calling then you‚Äôll never see them at all.‚Äù

WhatsApp will begin a global rollout of ads beginning Monday, but it will take time for all users to start seeing them, she added.

investing,Are SMA fees ever not disclosed on clients' statements?,"My spouse and I met with a wealth manager at TIAA this month for the first time about our employer-sponsored retirement plans.  We also have non-retirement funds at Merril Lynch, and we had provided recent statements from them to the TIAA wealth manager so he could see our overall financial picture.

During that meeting the TIAA person said that Merril was charging us hidden SMA fees of over 2%.  He said these do not appear anywhere on any of our statements from Merill, but they were in fact being drawn out of our accounts, even during market downturns, and that they were in addition to the regular advisory fees which do appear on our statements.  He even calculated a specific percentage and specific dollar amount and said what Merril was doing was technically legal, even if it was unethical. 

Merril denies that this is the case, and frankly I believe them.  To imagine that we are being charged fees that literally appear nowhere is inconceivable to me.   But then that makes me ask why the TIAA person would even say this.  Would SMA fees generally not appear on someone's statement?  In other words, is such a situation even possible?

This can strengthen their financial position, improve access to capital markets, and allow for more aggressive fiber build-outs

*  Finances remain healthy: Nearly $1B in dormant credit lines, manageable debt.

* B2B expansion: Residential customers are down but CABO business data segment grew +1.2% YoY.



Maybe not in the short term, but in my opinion, the stock has potential.

Shit makes no sense.', ""Both countries lack the ability to credibly invade and control the other. Obviously Iran can't really do shit projecting power, especially since its proxies are now neutered, and as far as Israel is concerned, Iran has 10x the population of Israel, is a thousand miles away, and is very mountainous. Even for the United States, the country with the best expeditionary\xa0capability in the world, invading and holding Iran is a nightmare proposition. Israel could try to kill Iran's top political leadership, but the United States reportedly vetoed the idea.\n\nIran contributes only a small percentage to the world oil market, so the immediate impact is minimal, and the idea of this conflict pushing Iran to the negotiating table and coming to a deal that relaxes sanctions is actually bullish. Conversely, much of the Red Sea trade has already rerouted around the Horn of Africa after the Houthi attacks, so an escalatory path via an Iranian blockade of the Strait of Hormuz has an already mitigated economic downside. Also, a blockade risks bringing the United States further into the conflict, whose air force can realistically destroy Iran's nuclear sites with non-nuclear bunker-busting ordinance. Note that earlier this year B-2 bombers were quite visibly deployed to Diego Garcia very likely as a signal to Iran, and these bombers remain in play as an option to actually finish the job and destroy Iran's nuclear ambitions. So Iran is deterred from escalating in a way that brings the United States directly into the war, either due to a blockade or a direct attack on US assets in the region, because then it's potentially game over for its nuclear sites.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Iran can credibly reassert its deterrence by striking back meaningfully; right now Iran looks fucking pathetic. Iran lost several nuclear scientists, so a crash program to a nuclear bomb is further set back. Iran could try a large ballistic missile attack on Israel (their most likely course of action), but its command and control was neutered by Israel and the Israeli air force has free reign over Iranian airspace, which is probably why Iran hasn't managed to launch one thus far. In sum, Iran has limited escalatory options, all risky, which is why they're publicly looking for an off-ramp.\n\nIn conclusion, calls."", 'Always has been regard', 'Has it ever not been?', 'A heavily 1 sided war is bullish yes.', 'Always has been', 'Always has been', 'War is going to end soon.

wallstreetbets,$ACDC: Near-term 100 Bagger on Oil,"# TLDR: Calls on $ACDC (ProFrac). If Oil goes to $100 a barrel or higher, it will go up over 100%. I'm expecting the Oil Algos to cause a Squeeze.


(Beware this is likely regarded)

**Intro:**

I'm the one who made the discussion post about the **Strait of Hormuz**. Basically, I think the oil market is mis-pricing this **catastrophic event**. I'm sure we've all seen the headlines. JP Morgan's simulations show that oil could reach **$120-$130** a barrel. It may be unlikely, but I think the odds are **non-zero.** While it is illiquid, **Polymarket has it at a 34% chance** at the time of writing. If Israel hits **Kharg Island,** Oil will skyrocket. It's safe to say, you can't find lottery tickets with odds like that.. **If the Strait is closed, or is seriously threatened, this could be a generational play**.

Now, there are dozens of tickers that give exposure to this, but I'm a **GREEDY** fuck. Even if it's a long-shot, I want exposure to the **maximum possible lotto**. Out of all the possible tickers, **$ACDC** is my favorite. It could easily go up **200-300%** from here if Oil makes any sudden large moves..

# $ACDC: Why?

I'll keep it simple, please consult the Google charts:

https://preview.redd.it/ksp6jkzri77f1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=bebb4fc4156a1f6b4596379da269704db973c9ae

https://preview.redd.it/1j9m2idti77f1.png?width=1514&format=png&auto=webp&s=32adad5615f27bb871a1e6687aad8e8c8ebdec37

Basically, **$ACDC** is highly correlated with oil prices. Instead of wasting our time putting it in my own words, here's what **Claude** says about their business model:

https://preview.redd.it/qimrp73wi77f1.png?width=1586&format=png&auto=webp&s=4403470e8248a6a167f6f0f2d1c0d0499fb4b5db

One important thing to note is the business becomes profitable at **$80** a barrel of WTI. This goes up massively at **$90, $100**, etc. That's basically the gist of it. Now for the fun part..

# Why it will Moon More Than Others:

Out of all the oil tickers, this one has the best setup for a big move. Here is the [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ACDC&p=d) Data:

https://preview.redd.it/356qfcfyi77f1.png?width=1490&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb497e4ed96f143eb23add87569e52d3d4312f67

* **Insider Ownership of 93.10%**
* **Institutional Ownership of 8.45%**
* **11.06m Shares Float**
* **Short Float Interest of 36.25%**
* **Short Interest of 4.01m Shares \^**

While surveying the dozens of tickers expected to move on oil going up, this one caught my eye. This mechanical setup lends itself to explosive gains. Based on the current option prices, this is a potential **100 bagger**. The price estimations for **$ACDC** at **$120 a barrel** put it over $20 a share.

The kicker is that if Oil makes an explosive move, **Algos will buy up these stocks like crazy**. It won't hold, but I think the Algos could easily send this stock to **over $30 a share**. The buying would be extraordinary. I want to take advantage of this..

**To be clear, Reddit will not move this stock**. This is all based on the price of oil. I just think the mechanical setup provides a nice lottery ticket in case of Oil emergencies. I plan to sit back and let the algos do their thing. I just expect this stock to jump much more than others on **the day of** an oil spike.

# Positions:

**This is a small position! It's just a lottery ticket**. Depending on the situation in the Middle East, I will buy more on expiration. If the stock goes over 20, the 12c will 100x!

(Note: This is not a reddit squeeze, this just has mechanics for a massive move from Algos. It stood out to me as the best mechanics from any of the oil plays. Also, this is not financial advice and is likely quite stupid.)

wallstreetbets,Reddit unveils AI-driven ad tools to help brands tap into user discussions,"June 16 (Reuters) - Reddit launched two new AI-powered advertising features on Monday aimed at helping brands drive greater engagement by tapping user conversations on the platform, the company said.

The company said its AI-driven tool, ""Reddit Insights"", would provide real-time insights to marketers for planning campaigns by identifying trends on the platform and testing campaign ideas.

It will also provide a feature called ""Conversation Summary Add-ons"", allowing brands to integrate ""positive"" user comments directly under the ads to show what they think about the ad subject.

Platforms such as Reddit, Snap (SNAP.N), opens new tab and Pinterest (PINS.N), opens new tab are leaning on AI-driven ad targeting tools to attract marketers in a fiercely competitive ad market amid economic uncertainties.
Reddit's announcement comes after WPP Media trimmed its forecast for global ad revenue growth to 6% from its prior target of 7.7% due to uncertainties related to changing U.S. trade policies.

Brands are expected to prioritize flexible ad contracts and accelerate the adoption of AI tools in ad production and user targeting, the media investment arm of ad group WPP (WPP.L), opens new tab said last week.

Last month, Reddit forecast second quarter revenue above Wall Street estimates, but CEO Steve Huffman said the company expected some disruption for traffic from Google search.
Reddit also launched new content moderation and analytics tools in March, aimed at helping people adhere to community rules and better understand content performance.

SecurityAnalysis,"MOMO: MoMo Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger","MOMO is China based social / dating app developer that will quietly turn from previously losing revenue year over year into growing revenue and net income year over year. This will be a major catalyst for stock.

MOMO has started to expand outside of Mainland China and into MENA region where it has an edge over US (cheaper engineering) and local companies (capital + engineering) companies.

**This post is not a financial advice, do your own diligence.**

MOMO was penalized last few years for consistent YoY revenue declines. I believe it is about to change soon. As MOMO returns back to growth it becomes growth at ridiculously low price play. Once Mr. Market realizes it, MOMO can get vastly higher earnings multiple.

# My Skin in the Game

**MOMO is 15% of my entire net worth.**¬†I also have 5.5k worth of in the money call options that expire on 6/20, this represents less than 1% of my total net worth. It is #2 position in my portfolio.¬†Only behind NBIS at 40% of my net worth. I consider myself highly concentrated value / growth at reasonable place disciple of Munger.

# Investor‚Äôs Checklist

If you care about fundamentals, MOMO checks every box:

* üìà¬†**TTM shareholder yiel**d: \~18% via dividends + buybacks\*(48M in dividends + 179M in buybacks at $7.56 = wild for a $1.3B market cap)\*
* üß†¬†**Insider ownershi**p: CEO/founder owns¬†**>2**5% of the company
* üí∞¬†**Operating incom**e: $191M TTM = \~18% return on capital employe, 22.5% earnings yield on its EV (hence such a higher shareholder yield).
* üíµ¬†**P/E rati**o: \~6
* **üè¶¬†Cash fortres**s:
   * Market cap: $1.3B, yet realistic acquirer EV is around 850 mil (or even less if you take 500 mil of restricted cash into account).
   * total liabilities of 753 mil.
   * vs 1.2 billion of cash in cash, long term deposits, short term deposits. This 1.2 billion doesn't take into account restricted cash.
   * As of March 31, 2025, the Company's cash, cash equivalents, short-term deposits, long-term deposits, short-term restricted cash and long-term restricted cash totaled RMB12,785.9 million (US$1,761.9 million).¬†[link](https://momoinc.gcs-web.com/static-files/8f840a6e-0552-43bb-a125-7758c0c521ac).

**And don‚Äôt forget**

* ‚úÖ¬†**Not a fraud**¬†‚Äì More cash returned post-IPO via dividends and buybacks than it raised
* üî•¬†**10% share count reduction YoY**
* **üí∏¬†Consistently pays varying special dividend once a year**.

# Why is it so cheap?

To begin with it is China based company, there is a discount for that alone but it'll stay no matter what until it diversifies out of China completely. Yet even with China discount applied it is still ridiculously cheap.

For the last few years MOMO had painted divergent picture:

* Since 2021 lost 35% of its revenue, yet increased its operating income margin. Net income lost 31% 2021 -> 2024.
* Shareholder yield was 18-20% at recent prices thanks to share buybacks and dividends.
* Since March 2022 slashed headcount from 2051 to 1336, slashed marketing costs to improve channel ROI.

# Inflection Point: Real Growth Returns

As of June 16, 2025, MOMO closed at $8.47. Despite 35% growth post earnings report I believe it is vastly undervalued and I'll explain it in the next few paragraphs.

Here is proof that management believes that YoY revenue growth could resume this year.

**‚Ä¶ and with acceleration of overseas business It is possible that the group level top line will turn to positive growth in the second half of the 2025 year. If that happens it would be a major structural turning point for us.**¬†\- CFO, last earnings call ([Webcast](https://momoinc.gcs-web.com/events/event-details/hello-groups-fourth-quarter-2024-earnings-conference-call), 55:55‚Äì56:10)

The company has been shrinking since Q1 2022. But now, growth is returning. MOMO quietly rebuilt its domestic mobile apps and established new frontiers. Its overseas apps are growing at 100%+ YoY / 38% + YoY respectively (Yahaland / Soulchill). Once again - Mr. Market might reprice MOMO based on return to growth. And Mr. Market doesn't need to wait for data to appear on investor relations website - usage numbers of their overseas apps can be obtained through mobile analytics services like SensorTower or proxied via app reviews

MOMO overseas revenue now accounts to 16% of total group revenue and is projected to grow 80% in the next quarter YoY. It is even possible to have QoQ revenue acceleration in this segment.

(Reuters) -Brussels negotiators hope that offering to accept U.S. tariffs of 10% across all of the European Union's exports into the United States will avert any higher duties on cars, drugs and electronics, newspaper Handelsblatt reported on Monday.

Citing high-ranking EU negotiators, the paper said the offer to U.S. counterparts would come only under certain conditions and would not be billed as permanent.

Handelsblatt also said the EU was, in return, ready to cut its tariffs on US-made vehicles, and to possibly change technical or legal hurdles to make it easier for US manufacturers to sell their cars in Europe.

The EU has also offered to completely ban purchases of Russian natural gas, potentially creating more demand for US producers.

The EU Commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The EU's position comes partly from the realisation that President Donald Trump will rely on some tariff revenues to fund planned tax cuts.

US negotiators, however, have so far not agreed to limit their import duties on EU cars to 10%, the paper added.",callsonreddit,86.04799999999999,13,2025-06-16 07:41:50,"['> Citing high-ranking EU negotiators, the paper said the offer to U.S. counterparts would come only under certain conditions and would not be billed as permanent.\n\nSounds like they‚Äôre just waiting for the next president', 'Trump is going to use tariff revenue to fund tax cuts?

President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Monday that they are signing a trade deal that will slash tariffs on goods from both countries.

The deal does not include tariffs on steel, an especially important piece of bilateral trade. Instead, talks are still going on about whether steel tariffs will be cut to zero as planned in the provisional agreement.

Trump and Starmer announced in May they‚Äôd struck an agreement that would slash U.S. import taxes on British cars, steel and aluminum in return for greater access to the British market for U.S. products including beef and ethanol.

But it did not immediately take effect, leaving British businesses uncertain about whether the U.K. could be exposed to any surprise hikes from Trump.

British businesses, and the U.K. government, were blindsided earlier this month when Trump doubled metals tariffs on countries around the world to 50%. He later clarified the level would remain at 25% for the U.K.

Starmer said Monday that the trade agreement is ‚Äúin the final stages now of implementation, and I expect that to be completed very soon.‚Äù

&#x200B;

If your question is ""I have $10,000, what do I do?"" or other ""advice for my personal situation"" questions, you should include relevant information, such as the following:

&#x200B;

\* How old are you? What country do you live in?  

\* Are you employed/making income? How much?  

\* What are your objectives with this money? (Buy a house? Retirement savings?)  

\* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?  

\* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)  

\* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors? Any other assets?)  

\* Any big debts (include interest rate) or expenses?  

\* And any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.  .

StockMarket,"Prompt for stock market indicators, with insight and trends to deepen your market understanding","I've seen a few posts on here that show a single chart with a prediction about where the markets are headed. We all know the market is more complex than any single metric and predictions are always going to be wrong to some degree. 

But if you are interested in trying to understand where things *may* be headed, then learning about the key indicators could be a good start. So I wanted to create and share something that might be useful to understand the markets and forces at play. 

I created a prompt that builds a summary table of the top indicators, their values, and how you could interpret them. Note, results will vary based on gen AI tool used, so verify with external research if you really want to be 100% sure of the figures. I used GROK 3.0 w/ deepsearch. I also used AI to help refine this list by asking if there are redundant indicators or glaring omissions. Helped me to remove Gold value and small business optimism.

How would you modify the prompt? What indicators would you add? 

What do you think of using a prompt and gen AI in this way? 

Prompt:

Create a table with the current values for each of these market indicators. Include columns the date from when these values are derived, a simple definition, insight into the current value, another that talks to the trend and another that provides a sentiment value.¬†

Indicators:

* Shiller CAPE
* VIX
* Equity-Bond Yield Spread
* Yield Curve Inversion
* Corporate Profit Margins
* ISM Manufacturing Index
* Leading Economic Index (LEI)
* Credit Spreads Widening
* Consumer Confidence
* Housing starts
* Retail sales
* Unemployment Rate

Context: I am an amateur investor that is looking to learn more about how the market moves as a system.¬†",sonJokes,100.18099999999998,0,2025-06-16 13:20:25,[],https://reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1lcyse1/prompt_for_stock_market_indicators_with_insight/,['VIX'],positive,101.0,neutral,50.0,[],positive,100.18099999999998,0
StockMarket,Should let this exercise or sell the contract?,"Hey Redditors, got a long  option contract here I‚Äôm still in the growth stage as I‚Äôm trying to reach a 100k in my personal account, I‚Äôm probably 15k away. I was wondering should I let this Amazon option contract exercise in the money and pick up 100 shares, I currently sit on about 70 shares of Amazon but wanted to at least hold like 150 shares. Another question If I have an option contract and I let it exercise I get the shares for the strike price and not the break even price correct?",Lower_Comfortable_33,90.95349999999999,3,2025-06-16 12:28:01,"['Right now that contract has about $0.20 of extrinsic value remaining.
