stocks,Trump approves U.S. Steel merger with Japan’s Nippon,"President Donald Trump issued an executive order on Friday approving U.S. Steel’s merger with Japan’s Nippon Steel, after the companies signed a national security agreement with the U.S. government.

U.S. Steel and Nippon said the national security agreement will give the U.S. government a “golden share” and makes certain commitments related to governance, domestic production, and trade. The companies did not elaborate on what powers the U.S. government will wield with its golden share.

“All necessary regulatory approvals for the partnership have now been received, and the partnership is expected to be finalized promptly,” U.S. Steel and Nippon said in a statement.

The national security agreement calls for Nippon to make $11 billion in new investments by 2028, including initial spending on a greenfield project that will be completed after 2028, the companies said.

Trump said Thursday that the golden share gives the president “total control” without elaborating. Pennsylvania Sen. Dave McCormick told CNBC last month that the golden share will effectively allow the government to control a number of board seats.

>The delivery comes two days after a Boeing (NYSE:[BA](https://www.investing.com/equities/boeing-co)) 787-8 Dreamliner with 242 people on board crashed in a fireball shortly after takeoff in western India.

>Boeing and Juneyao Airlines did not immediately reply to Reuters requests for comment on the Yicai report.

>The U.S. aerospace giant had suspended new aircraft deliveries to China in April as President Donald Trump’s tariff war escalated between the world’s two largest economies.

>Boeing said at the end of May that deliveries would resume this month after the tariffs were temporarily scaled back for 90 days.

>China and the U.S. concluded two days of negotiations in London on Tuesday to resolve key trade issues in the two superpowers’ bruising tariff war, where negotiators from Washington and Beijing agreed on a framework covering tariff rates.

>On Monday, a new Boeing 737 MAX painted in the livery of Xiamen Airlines landed in China, adding to signs that the planemaker was resuming deliveries to China. The country represents about 10% of Boeing’s commercial backlog and is an important and growing aviation market.

>Boeing had previously said customers in China would not take delivery of new planes due to the tariffs and that it was looking to resell potentially dozens of aircraft.

stocks,To those that mostly passively invest but set aside play money at a smaller percentage,"My dad is a degenerate gambler who blew up his own 401k as well as my moms (divorced now).  I’m probably more risky than some investors but a good deal of risk aversion from using my dad as an example in life. 

My problem is that for decades I have outperformed the market using a mix of passive and active investing but I have always reeled profits back into index investing.  The track record and history and math so far says I may do better if I was even more active an investor then passive.  The passive index angel on my shoulder tells me of course to not be cocky and the moment I do so I may lose a lot more then I anticipate. 

For example for today’s drawdown my own active investments made me lose $7.99 today.  When my mutual funds kicked in after market I was down almost 12k but still doing better than S&P.  The math says had I made my active portfolio a greater percentage of my funds than passive I would have reduced the loss significantly.  

And let’s say I am just cherry picking with selection bias. What if it is just time and time again for many years my active investments have done pretty amazing.  How many of you ever stop listening to the passive index investing angel on the shoulder and start listening to the active investor devil?

I have always kept my investments true to goals with healthy risk aversion despite literally decades telling me my active investment portfolio and choices do more than alright.  I would love to hear advice or thoughts of those in similar positions.  Not from people that have done awfully in active investments but those that have done amazing and need to make that decision to still keep their active investments in absolute check.  Or those that said to hell with it and went with active investments to either their benefit or detriment.

investing,Recommendations on Futuristic ETFs,"Interested in this sub's input on forward-thinking ETFs.

I've been heavy into VTI for several years now, and it has paid very well, because it builds our future.

However recently I got in early with $OKLO and it popped. This lead me to consider renewable energy ETFs since AI needs to draw **a lot** of electricity. There's a nuclear ETF (VanEck), but its low quality, hasn't been re-indexed in a long time. Doesn't include $OKLO.

What kind of ETFs have you dabbled in to get exposure to tech, energy, or other forward leaning sectors?

I'm also considering healthcare. It's such an incredibly unsexy sector that I can't seem to invest in it, even though with an aging world population it might be solid. I could be interested in subsectors like genetics, longevity, robotics, etc.

What's your ETF of the future?",Higgsy420,98.4455,4,2025-06-14 03:10:16,"['I think there are actually a few decent actively managed funds, but the problem that I have with very aggressive growth  funds is that they are often too indiscriminate or just not very good or the volatility is not worth the returns - especially looking over somewhat longer periods. \n\nI mean, take ARKK for example. ARKK did very well in 2020/21 because it was a broader ""disruptive growth"" bubble and that fund was in the very right investment place at the very right investment time. When 2022 happened, she stuck with ""2020\'s greatest hits"" all the way down. She missed the AI theme, selling NVDA near the bottom before it took off. She missed the obesity drug theme. Eventually, the Ark funds took a collective $22 billion dollars in realized losses. All the stuff she thought was ""the future"" in 2020 eventually lead to enormous realized losses, including 1.5B on TDOC. At least one ARK holding I can recall was a 0. \n\nIn the UK, Scottish Mortgage (despite the name, a very aggressive public/private growth fund) took giant losses on Moderna (at one point its top holding) and held battery co Northvolt into bankruptcy. That fund is still well under 2021 highs. \n\nIn terms of mutual funds, Nancy Zevenbergen\'s most aggressive fund (ZVGNX) is still off 2021 highs too, but closer than the other two. I\'ll say that that is probably the most aggressive growth mutual fund around and she\'s a better investor than Cathie is (and that fund\'s portfolio is better quality than ARKK\'s) but people go to stuff like this when the market is going up every day, then the moment that turns and the market stops going up every day they don\'t want to hold a fund like this. This fund is up 74% in the last 5 years, ARKK is just about back to flat. \n\n Too many things that are entirely speculative/early stage crater when the market turns like in 2021/22 and then when it comes back it\'s revealed that a lot of what they owned isn\'t great but ""might have been exciting at the time in a bubble"" (see ARKK and 22 billion in losses on all the things Cathie talked up in 2020.) I also have yet to see an aggressive growth mutual fund that has the ability to dial back even slightly. \n\nLook at a ZVGNX and you have a massive gain in 2020, craters in 2021/22, bounces back considerably in 2023/24 and yet... over a 5 year period if you had invested in the SPY you\'d have done better (SPY +96% vs ZVGNX +74%) with far less volatility. If you invested in Walmart you\'d have done better over the last 5 years than ""disruptive growth"" ARKK. \n\nTo me, the best option would be a more standard growth fund that would be able to make selective investments in more speculative/early stage growth - and that\'s really kind of how I invest. I don\'t know that I\'ve found that with a fund - some more standard growth funds invest in private companies, but it\'s often 1-2% of the fund.

TMO, RGEN and DHR are back to early days of covid levels. All the contract research cos are way down: IQV, MEDP, ICLR, etc. Do I know when that turn will happen? Definitely not, but if people are looking for quality companies that are certainly out of favor, those are interesting areas to look. The one healthcare real estate name (ARE) is about 70% off highs. The obesity drug theme feels like it\'s picked LLY as a winner (early discussion of new drug eloralintide appears to further that) and pretty much everything else in that theme has eroded to varying degrees. Biotech has not had a very good year and while I\'ve had three biotech buyouts this year, in terms of biotech investments overall I\'d be having an even better year (and it\'s managed to be a very good year) if it weren\'t for some of those.

If a biotech company that people think might be a buyout even *hints* that that\'s not happening anytime soon, investors flee. \n\n""genetics, longevity, robotics"" - I don\'t know that there\'s a compelling longevity company. Unity Biotechnology went public in 2018 playing itself up as an anti-aging play that Bezos had invested in. It\'s down about 99% since going public.

I like the idea of target funds, but when I look at various ""If I Had Invested"" calculators, it seems like VOO is way, way stronger. 

A friend of mine who knows more about finance than I do said he doesn't really like target funds, as you can miss out on a lot closer to your retirement date as the funds switch to bonds, etc. 

Obviously, the market could totally tank, but looking at the long term, do people see VOO as being a stronger investment than target funds? ",AlwaysSitIn12C,101.0805,12,2025-06-14 09:20:54,"['If you\'re targeting a retirement far in the future, in your early years a target date fund will be highly or entirely focused on equities, so there may not be much of a difference. It\'s as you approach retirement, TDF funds gradually de-risk to protect from downside risk.\n\nYou can still tailor your risk/growth profile with target date funds. For example if you plan on retiring in 2040 but want to be more risk tolerant, you could buy into a 2050 date fund. \n\n> Obviously, the market could totally tank\n\nIt\'s not ""could.""

It was right around the corner. Then we had the global financial crisis, and practically ""I can retire at 55"" turned into ""I\'m going to be working indefinitely, I\'ll be lucky if I can retire at 65.""\n\nSo as to ""which is stronger"" it depends what you mean by that. A TDF can ""beat the market"" if you\'re close to retirement and we have an economic downturn.\n\nGotta weigh the big picture.

SecurityAnalysis,2 investment ideas from Columbia Business School’s Analyst’s Edge (Fall 2024),"Today, I’m returning to Columbia Business School (CBS) once again to explore a third source of ideas: the latest student investment theses from *The Analyst’s Edge — Fall 2024 edition.*

  
The Analyst’s Edge is an application-only course at CBSwhere 8 to 10 students each year learn what it takes to become world-class investors. Each student writes a full investment thesis on a stock of their choice — often actionable, deeply researched, and grounded in the Graham & Dodd investing tradition that has long shaped Columbia’s value investing culture.

In this post, I’ll share what I found after reading this latest batch of theses. The ideas range from global compounders to special situation plays — all written with the disciplined lens of fundamental investors.



# MercadoLibre (MELI)

*Recommendation: Long*

*Analyst: Chris Zeng*

The thesis on MELI highlights the company’s position as the dominant e-commerce and fintech platform in Latin America, with a powerful ecosystem and long runway for growth. The analyst argues that MELI will continue to benefit from secular trends driving digital adoption across the region, while its unique integrated model — combining marketplace, payments (Mercado Pago), credit, logistics, and other services — deepens its competitive moat.

MELI holds the #1 market share in Latin America for e-commerce, with significant advantages in logistics, brand trust, and scale. The e-commerce market in LatAm remains underpenetrated, with strong growth ahead: only \~56% of adults shop online today, and per-capita spending is expected to grow at a 21% CAGR.

The fintech segment, Mercado Pago, is an even larger opportunity, with total retail payment volume in LatAm estimated at $2.35 trillion. Mercado Pago is growing off-platform payment volume faster than on-platform, and is helping drive financial inclusion in a region with low credit card penetration. MELI’s credit business leverages proprietary data from the marketplace and payment platforms to manage risk better than traditional banks.

**Key drivers** include MELI’s flywheel effects — the integration of marketplace activity, logistics (Mercado Envios), and payments creates increasing user stickiness. Logistics is a strong moat: MELI operates the fastest and most reliable delivery network in the region, outperforming Amazon and newer entrants. Other potential growth drivers include insurance (leveraging marketplace data for targeted offerings) and Q-commerce (quick delivery services).

**Risks** include near-term margin pressure from logistics investments, credit card expansion (especially in Mexico), and rising competition from Amazon, Shopee, and emerging players like Temu and Shein. However, the analyst argues that recent margin compression is a moat-widening investment and that MELI’s network effects, brand, and data advantages will help it maintain leadership.

**Valuation is attractive:** MELI trades at 4x EV/NTM Sales, well below historical levels (it traded at 19x at the 2021 peak), while still growing revenues at \~40% YoY. The thesis expects further margin improvement and operating leverage as the business scales, and sees MELI as a long-term compounder and a key proxy for LatAm’s accelerating digital economy.  


# Tesla (TSLA)

*Recommendation: Long*

*Analyst: Landon Clay*

The market is significantly underestimating the long-term impact of autonomous driving (Full Self-Driving / FSD), the explosive potential of energy storage, and the optionality embedded in Tesla’s broader innovation pipeline (including the Optimus humanoid robot). Landon forecasts a 73% probability-weighted upside based on 6-year projections, with potential to 5x 2023 EBIT by 2030.

Tesla is positioned not simply as an EV manufacturer but as a vertically integrated tech ecosystem, with competitive advantages in data, manufacturing, and AI. Its massive fleet of \~7 million cars acts as a global data collection engine for training FSD. This dataset gives Tesla an edge over competitors relying on LIDAR and HD maps. The upcoming FSD Version 13 is expected to drive higher adoption (currently sub-10%), with robotaxi ambitions potentially unlocking massive new revenue streams.

The company’s energy storage business — currently growing at \~26% QoQ CAGR — is emerging as a second core business. Tesla already holds 20% GWh market share, and Bloomberg projects 30x growth in global energy storage by 2035. With its Shanghai Megafactory and U.S. capacity expansion, Tesla is positioned to be a top player in this market, generating high-margin recurring revenue.

The Optimus robot is a long-dated call option. While speculative, Landon notes that success here could create trillions in market value. Tesla’s AI training stack and proprietary manufacturing give it a credible path to lead in this space — though realization is likely 5–10 years out.

On the core EV business, TSLA remains the global leader in production efficiency, battery technology, and brand loyalty. The shift to the new “unboxed” production process could increase manufacturing efficiency by 40%, enabling margin expansion even as ASPs decline. The U.S. market still has significant room to grow EV penetration (currently \~10% of new sales), and FSD success could further accelerate demand.

**Key risks** include failure of FSD to reach full autonomy, key-man risk around Elon Musk, geopolitical or commodity price shocks, and potential regulatory hurdles. However, the thesis argues that Tesla’s innovation-driven culture, scale advantages, and multi-business model flywheel give it asymmetric upside compared to traditional auto peers.

At **current valuation** (with EV/EBIT multiples expected to compress from \~116x to \~75x), the analyst sees significant room for Tesla to compound value across its automotive, energy, and AI segments over the next decade.

SecurityAnalysis,Looking for standout Value Investors Club (VIC) investment write-ups — preferably winning ideas,"Hi all,

I’m currently researching **“winner” investment theses selected by VIC**.

My goal is to analyze and learn from these top-rated ideas, and eventually write a post discussing key patterns, insights, and what makes a VIC thesis exceptional.

If you have a list of your favorite VIC “winner” write-ups (or know where to find a good collection of them), I’d really appreciate it.

**P.S.** I’ve already come across some great theses — both “winners” and not — written by or attributed to well-known investors like **Mohnish Pabrai, Michael Burry, and Norbert Lou**. But for this project, I'm aiming to go beyond the big names and focus on VIC’s own selection of **winning ideas**, regardless of who authored them.

StockMarket,Are we due for another stock market crash?,"These companies are left holding up the stock market. 
If they fall, the entire market falls. And it’s the opposite if they all go up the whole market goes up. But the chart tells a different story of the recent trend. They are going up but rest of market is going down. 
Here is what i think of the stocks left holding up the market. 

AAPL - weakness in innovation, losing growth

MSFT - might be overbought here

META - good ad business but questionable ai product profitability 

NFLX - high pe might give back massive gains its had

NVDA - ai sales increase already priced in. everyone says 170 eoy yet price is stalling. People relying on eoy to save them usually not a good thing. 

AMZN - aws has competition with new datacenter companies emerging. Needs to take on more debt just to maintain its margin intensive shipping business 

GOOG - losing search dominance, ai is good but not perfect yet, to maintain ai dominance intensive spending must happen will affect earnings

COST - taking a hit from tarrifs, it had a monster run and might give back a lot of gains

StockMarket,Global Liquidity Tide Is finally Rising Once Again,"The world’s major central banks have already begun to tiptoe away from 2022-24’s broad tightening. Policy rates are being cut, money-supply growth has turned positive again, and even the Federal Reserve has started to slow quantitative-tightening. 

That said, the shift is cautious: real policy rates are still above zero in most advanced economies, balance-sheet runoff is only tapering (not reversing), and inflation is still hovering above target. In other words, the expansion cycle is underway, yet it remains early, deliberate and fragile.

Why the pivot is considered an “expansion cycle”

A monetary expansion is usually marked by three concurrent signals: lower policy rates, rising money-supply/credit growth, and central-bank balance-sheet support. When all three start moving in the same direction, liquidity conditions ease for households and firms, setting the stage for the next growth upswing.

Key evidence so far

Federal Reserve – mild but clear easing bias
After lifting the fed-funds rate to 4.50 % in 2023, the Fed cut three times in 2024. Futures now price two more quarter-point cuts by October 2025 while policymakers project the same number in their “dot plot”.  ￼
QT is still running, yet the FOMC voted on 19 March 2025 to slow the monthly runoff cap – an explicit step toward ending balance-sheet shrinkage.  ￼ ￼

European Central Bank – eight cuts and counting
The ECB lowered its deposit rate again in early June, to 2 %, its eighth cut since June 2024, comfortably moving policy back inside its estimated neutral range. Bank of England delivered its first trim in February and market-implied rates point to additional reductions in August and November as UK growth stalls near 1 %.  ￼ ￼

Money-supply and credit gauges – bottoming out
US M2 is growing again at roughly 4 % y/y (January 2025), its highest pace since late-2022.  ￼
Haver Analytics notes that money growth is “positive and rising except for Japan,” signaling a synchronised global inflection.  ￼

S&P 500 forward returns - baseline expectations point to total returns around 8-12 % a year for the S&P 500 through 2026 – roughly 6-8 % earnings growth plus 2-4 % dividends/​buybacks – assuming valuations bleed lower but not abruptly. A repeat of 2020-21’s 20-30 % surges looks unlikely unless inflation drops faster than expected and the Fed reopens full-scale asset purchases. In short, monetary easing should be good for stocks, just not great by recent pandemic-era standards.",careyectr,90.669,8,2025-06-14 15:10:48,"['Agree with all of this, and this is driving markets up and keeping a floor on them.

🔸 Monday: Trump announced a meeting between U.S. and China on 9 June in London last friday. The week began with this news and the stock market opened slightly higher. During the session, we were not hear any updates. The stock market closed nearly same point with open state. 🟢

🔸 Tuesday: Commerce Secretary Lutnick said going well about meeting after yesterday's session. The stock market opened slightly higher again. In the session, Commerce Secretary Lutnick said U.S. and Chinese talks going really well and hope end this evening. Also, U.S. and Mexico near deal to cut steel duties and cap imports. The stock market waited for result from meeting and closed higher. 🟢

🔸 Wednesday: Important key datas will be released in the next 3 day. First one was CPI inflation. It came below expectations, but it raised from 2.3% to 2.4% for annual. The meeting has ended. U.S and China completed a 'framework' and send to Trump, Xi for approval. Trump said done. The stock market opened higher. Meanwhile, Scott Bessent pointed to increase U.S. debt ceiling must be raised and extended. It could be biggest crises since 2008-09. China will add 10% tariff on U.S. products and U.S. will add 55% tariff on China products. Both of news was positive, but the stock market closed lower. The S&P 500 remained above 6,000. 🔴

🔸 Thursday: Like CPI inflation, PPI inflation came below expectations, but it raised from 2.4% to 2.5% for annual. Trump said China deal is great. U.S. Dollar Index falls below 97.5 since March 2022. The stock market opened lower. During the session, gold hit $3,400 again amid Israel attacks on Iran. Bessent said he believes we will see more trade deals coming very quickly. The stock market recovered and closed higher. 🟢

🔸 Friday: Israel striked Iran. Oil and gold prices spiked. The stock market opened under heavy selling pressure. Michigan 1-Year Inflation Expectations preliminary came at 5.1%. It was 6.6% in previous month. Conflict made pressure on the all over the world and the stock market closed lower. The S&P 500 dropped below 6,000 again. 🔴

The S&P 500 closed 6,000 last week. It came nearly all-time-high value, but it struggled to reach this value. Israel-Iran conflict pulled it back to below 6,000. After the under 5,000 values, it made a strong recover. A bit correction could be healthy for the next level. The S&P5 00 has a gap between 5,820 and 5,843. I think, this points could be good enry point for new positions. On the other hand, if we could reach to 6,100 points, we can open positions there. By the way, gold is benefiting from conflicts. It may be in the portfolio. I've been keeping for a long time. It's a bit insurance. How was your week? What do you think?

Returns here represent the market cap-weighted average for each GICS sector. Each stock’s contribution is calculated as its return multiplied by its market cap, then divided by the total market cap of the sector. This method reflects the performance of each sector as influenced by the size of its individual constituents.

X-axis shows 5-day return. Y-axis shows 1-month return. Bubble size reflects the total sector market cap.

Take these ratings with a grain of salt.  \nWhen buying a bond, the primary driver of the interest rate associated with it is the credit worthiness of the bond issuer (historically, the U.S. government was considered safest, but this is starting to change), the maturity, e.g. because the credit of the issuer and interest rates can change over the life of the bond, current interest rates at the time of issuance.\n\nMost bonds pay back the full principle at maturity, so unless you sell before maturity, you should not lose principal unless you sell before the bond matures or the issuer defaults. \n\nBonds typically trade at $1,000 face value.  If a bond is bid at 99 1/2, it means $995.00.  Most bonds are bought from dealers at the ask price and valued in your account at the bid price, which means you immediately have a small loss when your position is marked to the market in your brokerage account, unless you do exceptionally well timing the market.  Fear not because this small loss will come out in the wash if held to maturity.  \n\nAnother thing to keep your eye on is any call features that are described in the bond issue.  Typically, a bond issuer can buy back a bond after issuance at par or $1,000.  This can suck if rates are falling and your bond rises in value because it has a higher rate or coupon but gets called away so the issuer can refinance.', 'US gov issues US Bond.\n\nIf Japan (largest holder in the world) buys one, Japan is essentially borrowing USA money at certain interest rate.\n\nCurrently, thanks to trump admin, US bond is shaky bc other countries do not trust that US will pay them back.

StockMarket,"[ORCL] Larry Ellison's customer: ""We will take all the capacity you have wherever it is""","\[Edit: reposted images in higher resolution\]

I view Oracle’s (ORCL) post earnings market rally as an extension of the company’s premium valuation. The FY’25 report assured investors that the company is delivering, which is likely contributing to an extrapolation of success estimates for the company.

Summarizing my valuation below, I estimate an intrinsic value for Oracle of around $324 or $113 per share with projected revenues of $180B by the end of my 10-year forecast period. I also expect the company to maintain momentum and increase its operating margin to 35% by 2030 via cross-selling to new customers and upgrading its infrastructure to an autonomous cloud. In my view, the current rally is pricing the fundamentals above a 5-year premium which is too much of a risk.

At these price-levels I suspect that many investors \[including myself\] may have missed the boat on Oracle, and that is ok.

# Oracle Is Entering A Growth Upcycle

In Oracle’s FY 25 earnings call, they outlined their move to ramp up cloud infrastructure capacity in order to meet an unprecedented $138B worth of remaining performance obligations – A number which is expected to continue growing.

Oracle’s chairman, Mr. Ellison noted that they recently got an order that said

*“We will take all the capacity you have wherever it is.”*

While the statement is true, keep in-mind that it’s also a well-crafted pitch to investors.

The company posted a record $57.4B FY ‘25 revenue, up 8% from the $52.96B in 2024, with the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure \[OCI\] contributing 74%. The company expects to break out of its single digit growth rate, and has guided for a >16% revenue growth in 2026.

There is currently a supply constraint for cloud infrastructure across the industry, and as long as AI applications are producing meaningful demand I expect the revenue growth for Oracle to persist. In my model, I will pull the revenue growth line forward for the next 4 years, but I do expect normalization after that and revert to single digit growth.

As you can see from the image below, the problem I have with Oracle is that revenues did not meaningfully improve prior to 2022 i.e. when AI entered the scene.

https://preview.redd.it/v8alsu553v6f1.png?width=1039&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a6fa899bdd9d32d43eb57aa51ec7b4c38607f86

In my view, the pre-2022 stagnation was a reflection of a brand-name impact from the past that kept customers away from Oracle’s products. Further, AWS and other cloud vendors provided viable alternatives, drawing market share. However, Oracle now has a chance to reinvent itself as more customers are steered into their cloud due to the lack of supply among cloud peers.

# Going All In On The Cloud

The company has invested $21.2B in capex, primarily consisting of infrastructure for the cloud business. For 2026, Oracle is intending to ramp up capex to over $25B.

The company is making a large bet on the cloud, and is even increasing leverage by around $5.6B to fund the projects. They will likely further increase debt levels in order to build their data centers, but I see this as an opportunity to positively recapitalize the company and maximize returns. For reference, Oracle currently has some $115B in debt, representing a Debt to Equity \[market value\] ratio of 18.6%. In my view, the company has room to increase this ratio and taking on more debt to fund a high-demand business is the right move.

# Oracle’s Pitch To AI Demand: The Vector Database

The fundamental product for Oracle is the database. Everything that oracle does, ties in some way to their database products with the core being relational (table) databases such as MySQL. Over time, the company has launched products that complement their database products by offering a place to host their database - such as the cloud, and creating software products from the database such as their ERP/CRM products.

Note that alongside the database, Oracle provides all the standard cloud products such as compute, storage, and their derivatives.

Now with the rise of AI demand, Oracle is optimizing the database for use of AI applications. This comes in the form of a vector database (highly recommended Fireship's YT video on vector databases) that is able to store data by similarity via embeddings, allowing AI applications to draw additional context from the database when the user makes a query.

https://preview.redd.it/uhv4ndf10v6f1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=85dae7283c5e4d350e6be0c42f835ff3709d6126

Oracle is pitching the vector database as a way for customers to increase the efficacy of their AI model, as well as a completely private product that can be accessed in the cloud. This enables customers to use their own proprietary data for context so that the AI model can produce tailored results. Oracle is not the only vector product on the market, and the space has seen a surge of innovation, but the company does offer database privacy features that are key to customers with proprietary data.

In my view, it will be a tight race between all cloud providers as they innovate in rapid succession. While Oracle holds the rights for MySQL and lends them under license agreements, competitors offer the open-source alternatives such as Postgresql - a highly scaleable relational database \[with many plugins, including for vector data\]. These alternatives are offered and supported in all large cloud providers such as AWS, Google Cloud, etc. This is why I don’t expect Oracle to maintain any persistent technological edge, and that their primary revenue driver will be the supply shortage for cloud infrastructure.

About a year ago, I was in a cloud presentation event. After the keynotes, we were chatting around with people. Most of the programmers shared their experience with either AWS or Google, and there was only 1 person that pitched Oracle cloud. He was a bit more on the eccentric side, but made a compelling argument about the price to performance for OCI. In the future, I expect OCI to go much more mainstream among the development community, developers to start experimenting, and later pitching their managers for OCI.

However, at the end of the day Oracle’s largest revenue contributors will continue being enterprise-level companies, so a bet on Oracle is a bet that these companies are going to need cloud & database products and a direct line of support.

# Valuation

Using the assumptions and updated numbers, I have constructed an unlevered DCF model for Oracle:

* Revenue growth 20%, 25%, and 20% in the next three years respectively. Converging on the riskfree rate after that. This results in revenues of $180B at the end of my forecast period, up some 3x from 2025.
* An increase in profitability after the infrastructure ramp due to moving an increasing portion of infrastructure from gen. 2 cloud to an autonomous cloud.
* Total reinvestment \[net of depreciation\] around $20B in the next 2 years.
* Negative free cash flows during the ramp period, up to 46B in year 10.
* Low, 8.5% cost of capital from the outset reflecting the stability of the organization.

https://preview.redd.it/s3bzxvh93v6f1.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=bdd8aa0fb5d4daa040fc0a39ed444216b8b7804b

The sum of present value comes up to $421, netting out debt and cash, I get an intrinsic value of $324 or $113 per share for the company.

While the debt is a great financing vehicle for CapEx investment, it still weighs on the final valuation and is reducing the intrinsic value by some $100B.

# Pricing At Maturity

Using the forecasts from my model, I estimate that Oracle will be able to produce around $46B in free cash flows by the end of my 10-year forecast period. At a 2035 20x FCF multiple, the forward pricing comes up to $920B. Discounting at a 8.5% rate back 10 years, I get a pricing of $407B or **$142** per share.

`[920 / 1.085^10 = 407]`

By comparing both approaches we see that despite being overvalued at the current price levels, the value of the equity may rise by an 8.5% CAGR for 10 years to reach a $920B valuation. I did not assign any excess returns to the company as I expect increased competition in the cloud infrastructure space, database innovation, and the ERP software.

My $920B pricing is indicative of just how far investors can take Oracle’s valuation with the *generous* assumption that they can wait out the price to value gap. In my view, if Oracle breaks above this point, its fundamentals will be fully priced-in for the next 10 years.

# Conclusion

As of the time of writing, Oracle has a market cap of $618B, indicating that the market is ahead of my $324B valuation by around 7 years, and 5 years ahead of my $407B pricing. This indicates that investors need to hold the company for 5-7 years before the fundamentals break-even on the current price.

In my view, 3 years is an acceptable premium for quality companies, and barring any major flaws in my predictions, I view the risk to return asymmetry to be unfavorable at the current price.

Using my intrinsic value, the 3-year premium range for the company would come up to $144 per share, which is where I would consider Oracle to be a portfolio candidate.

`[113 * 1.085^3 = 148]`

The company is on a growth uptrend, and I expect it to continue for at least the next 2 years. AI may not be the only growth driver, and Oracle may sustain higher growth rates from its ERP software applications, as well as the opening up of dormant cloud demand for industries such as the military industry with the digitization of drones. Because of this, it is likely that the company will continue trading 3 to 5 years ahead of the fundamentals.

Investors that had a position in the company pre-earnings may consider taking profit after the company shows a slowdown in its acceleration, which may take at least a few quarters. Finally, going short on the stock may not be wise despite the price being ahead of the fundamentals.

# Risks

* The cloud infrastructure demand cycle may be shorter than expected, and many customers may abandon their AI projects or switch to ready-made solutions by some of the large vendors. Innovation avenues in this space may become more narrow and the demand for training compute will alleviate the supply shortage.
* Large AI vendors may produce breakthroughs in the amount of compute required for AI inference and training, significantly changing the demand curve. Google, Microsoft and most other large vendors are already releasing light versions of their models \[phi, gemma\].
* Oracle had a 10-year period with little meaningful growth pre-2022 which was partly driven by the innovation of database technologies from cloud competitors. If the company fails to maintain a unique aspect to their value proposition \[such as the mentioned private cloud\], it will find it difficult to keep up growth after the next few years.
* Customers may switch their database preferences from a centralized and highly scalable database like MySQL to smaller and localized versions such as SQLite. MySQL is a good fit for large companies, but there is a case to be made that SMBs do not require the scale of a database of Oracle’s caliber. The development community has been increasingly experimenting with smaller and open-source alternatives, which may lead to more pitches from developers to managers to switch to lighter alternatives.
* Oracle’s software and infrastructure is sometimes reported to be difficult to work with. This has been a drag on the company’s brand reputation for software and databases alike.
* AI is great at producing insights from technical documentation, which enables easier implementations & troubleshooting of alternative databases, eroding Oracle’s support services moat.
* Oracle will keep maintaining pricing power relative to the quality of their competitors – if at any point competitive databases become higher quality or less risky to adopt, we will likely see an increase in the quality of Oracle products.",ThinkValue2021,93.2485,3,2025-06-14 05:11:55,"['OP, is this driven by the forced push of on prem enterprise customers to Oracle Fusion cloud?', 'But oracle has to 10x their gpus to meet all this demand which will cause more debt and how long will it take them to get rid of the debt which they already have tons of.', 'Why do the images look so blurry unless you click on them... :/']",https://reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1lb4fcs/orcl_larry_ellisons_customer_we_will_take_all_the/,"['MSFT', 'GOOG', 'ORCL']",positive,77.6,negative,11.184,"[3.942000000000001, 3.2850000000000046, 26.325]",negative,44.0098,3
