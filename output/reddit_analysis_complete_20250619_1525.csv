stocks,MSFT may terminate expanded OpenAI deal as tensions rise over control and equity,"According to the Financial Times Microsoft may terminate ongoing talks to deepen its partnership with OpenAI citing unresolved disputes over governance and future equity structure

The core issue OpenAI is pushing to formally transition into a for-profit entity which could potentially dilute Microsoft influence and ownership stake in the company  especially concerning any future models beyond GPT-4

Sources say that unless key terms are agreed upon Microsoft is ready to fall back on its existing commercial agreement which guarantees access to OpenAI models through 2030  unless a competitor matches or exceeds Microsoft's deal

Another twist OpenAI transition plan reportedly needs Microsoft formal approval by Dec 31, 2025. Without that green light OpenAI may risk losing interest from outside investors like SoftBank and other late-stage capital.

Despite the headlines, Microsoft commercial use case remains protected in the shorttomid term. But the question now is who controls the roadmap to GPT-5 and beyond  and whether Microsoft sees enough ROI to keep playing ball.

Is MSFT losing strategic leverage here? Or are they just protecting their current ROIÔºüCould this open the door for Google, Amazon, or even Meta to get in bed with OpenAI?How would a fractured OpenAI impact Azure‚Äôs AI moat vs AWS and GCP?MSFT may terminate expanded OpenAI deal as tensions rise over control and equity

The ultimate end state is everyone having their own agent.\nThe agent needs to know everything about you and Google has that. Google has Gmail, Google Photos, etc. Nobody else has close to the same.\n\n4) Now the biggest reason Google will win. They are able to add their different services to Gemini.

stocks,Texas Instruments Unleashes $60 Billion Chip Investment Surge,"Texas Instruments *(TXN)* just announced a $60B commitment to expand U.S. semiconductor manufacturing, the largest in its history.

* *""Texas Instruments plans to invest over $60 billion in US to make foundational chips""*  \- Reuters, Bloomberg. 
* Unusual News Volume Factor: 6x its normal. 
* **Stock Reaction: +0.33% today | -0.71% over 5D.** 

News Highlights:  
Texas Instruments (TXN) has announced a sweeping $60 billion commitment to expand its domestic semiconductor operations marking what it calls the largest investment in foundational chip manufacturing in U.S. history.

The investment will fund the construction or expansion of seven chip fabrication plants across three sites in Texas and Utah, including two new facilities in Sherman, TX. The company estimates the initiative will create up to 60,000 jobs across the supply chain and construction ecosystem.

Back in August 2024, TI had outlined a roadmap to build out seven fabs, with projected spending of $40 billion in Sherman and an additional $21 billion across its Utah and other Texas sites. This week's announcement formalizes that vision while slightly increasing the total budget.

The company is aggressively ramping up in-house manufacturing capacity to reduce reliance on overseas supply chains and counter the rise of Chinese analog chip competitors. The effort aligns with broader U.S. policy initiatives to reshore critical technology production.

While no detailed timeline was disclosed, Texas Instruments noted that the capital will be allocated over multiple years, with approximately $46 billion earmarked for Texas and $15 billion for Utah. TI emphasized that its long-term capital expenditure plan remains consistent, underscoring a strategic rather than reactive expansion.

stocks,GD lands $986.8M submarine development contract modification,"WASHINGTON  The U.S. Department of Defense has awarded General Dynamics Electric Boat a $986.8 million contract modification to support development work tied to the Columbiaclass ballistic missile submarine and related nuclear shipbuilding programs.

The costplusfixedfee award supplements a previously issued contract enhancing design, supply chain and industrial base support across multiple platforms including the Virginiaclass submarines and Ford-class aircraft carriers.

$16M in UK funding supports the Common Missile Compartment effort between the U.S. and UK.

Work to be carried out in Groton CT 70% Newport News VA 15% and Quonset Point RI 15%

Completion projected by December 2031

Majority funding from the FY25 National Sea-Based Deterrence Fund ($794.1M).

Oversight by NAVSEA Naval Sea Systems Command in D.C

The deal aligns with Pentagon and Navy strategic guidance for submarine force recapitalization, addressing capacity constraints identified in a recent FY25 industrial base study.

With rising global maritime threats and mounting pressure on U.S. shipyards GD remains a key pillar in sustaining undersea dominance  but execution risk and industry labor challenges persist.

stocks,Eutelsat and France‚Äôs Armed Forces Ministry Reach Landmark Framework Agreement for Low Orbit Satellite Services in the NEXUS Program,"Eutelsat (ISIN: FR0010221234 - Euronext Paris / London Stock Exchange: ETL) and France‚Äôs armed forces ministry (Direction g√©n√©rale de l'armement) have today announced a landmark framework agreement on the occasion of the Paris Airshow.

The agreement is the embodiment of the NEXUS (Neo-Espace pour de multiples Usages S√©curis√©s) program launched by the French Ministry of Defence, which aims to reinforce the current French military space communications model by combining military and civilian resources.

France reaffirms its commitment to the European IRIS¬≤ program, which has been supported from the outset since the French Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2022. However, the urgency of the international situation means that it cannot wait until then.

As the first concrete step in the NEXUS project, the French defense procurement agency (DGA) has reached a 10-year framework agreement, valued at up to ‚Ç¨1 billion in expenditure, with Eutelsat, covering the supply of priority-access space resources (notably capacity on Eutelsat‚Äôs OneWeb LEO constellation), the hosting of ancillary missions for the French armed forces, and operational and security maintenance. The agreement also covers the upgrading and securing of the constellation for military grade use.

Jean-Francois Fallacher, Chief Executive Officer of Eutelsat commented: ‚ÄúWe are honored at the prospect of supporting the French armed forces through this historic agreement, which underscores the crucial role of low earth orbit satellite capacity in responding to the requirements of contemporary operational theaters. Eutelsat today offers the only commercially operated LEO constellation capable of meeting stringent military standards ahead of the deployment of IRIS¬≤. It provides global coverage, low latency, rapid deployment, and adaptability to mobile use cases, attributes validated by successful large-scale experiments conducted with the French Armed Forces.‚Äù

stocks,Palantir's little hardware bro Voyager Technologies (VOYG) and the Golden Dome,"Palantir is like 95% software and 5% hardware and Voyager (a¬†**strategic partner with headquarters on the same street somewhere in Colorado**) is the opposite - it makes a bunch of space/national security stuff.

They might be a ying and yang to the defense game of the future, think two sides of the same coin.

Now:

If Voyager captures just 1.5% of the initial phase of the Golden Dome budget ($25 billion expected in 2026), its annual revenue that year would increase by approximately 2.5x compared to 2024.

And with $150 billion still to be spent by January 2029 to make the Dome operational, capturing 1.5% of that amount would generate¬†**revenue close to Voyager‚Äôs current market cap.**

stocks,Is SPOT overvalued?,"I understand that stocks can keep moving up longer than anyone expects, but I've been watching Spotify for over a year without buying or shorting, just thinking it has to come down. Especially from January to April when SPOT and many stocks seemed to be creating massive head and shoulders, and proceeded to just run and break that potential setup. 

SPOT's market cap is $145b, they were profitable last year for the first time at $1.23b profit from $17b revenue, now with $8.56b cash and cash equivalents on hand, and with debt of $2.27b. 

They have a P/E of 105 and a forward P/E of 67, with their EPS estimates continuously increasing, but they seem to generally miss these targets, last time being by over 50%.

stocks,Coinbase Launches Stablecoin Payments Service for E-Commerce,"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-18/coinbase-launches-stablecoin-payments-service-for-e-commerce

> Coinbase Global Inc. is launching a platform designed to make stablecoins a go-to payment method for online transactions, a potentially big leap forward in the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies meant to track the US dollar.

> The announcement follows the passage of landmark stablecoin legislation in the US Senate on Tuesday and comes as large retailers have expressed interest in exploring stablecoins for use as payments in online transactions, a roughly $6 trillion industry. Such use of this type of cryptocurrency threatens to circumvent card networks Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. and other online payment services.

> Coinbase Payments is targeting online platforms like Shopify Inc. and eBay Inc., a prized client segment among payment processors since the websites provide distribution to thousands of small-to-medium sized businesses who are often looking for ways to avoid the fees associated with accepting card payments. Today, Coinbase makes most of its money through transaction fees on the exchange‚Äôs cryptocurrency trades.

investing,Amazon's $84M stake on AMD. A sleeper AI bet?,"Amazon bought 822,234 shares of AMD, worth about $84.5 million as of March 31. It‚Äôs the first time Amazon has ever disclosed a stake in the semiconductor company. It also happened to be the only new position in their entire portfolio last quarter.

At the time of the filing, AMD‚Äôs stock was down \~6% YTD while the broader chip sector was almost flat. Then, just one week after the 13F dropped, AMD announced a $6B stock buyback boosting its total repurchase capacity to $10B. This came right after unveiling a $10B AI partnership with Saudi-backed startup Humain, which is building Arabic LLMs and data center infrastructure across the Middle East.

Amazon‚Äôs cloud division, AWS, already uses AMD‚Äôs EPYC chips in some of its instances. With Nvidia supply tight and AMD pushing its MI300X AI accelerators, the move might hint at deeper strategic alignment. It‚Äôs also possible Amazon wanted to lock in a chip partner for its growing AI infrastructure push especially as it faces off with Microsoft and Google.

AMD was trading nearly 40% off its 52-week high when Amazon bought in.

investing,From Decentralized Hype to Centralized Risk: The Stablecoin Trap,"
The new stablecoin legislation that was pushed through the Senate this week effectively ties the U.S. Treasury to crypto, because nothing says ‚Äúsound fiscal footing‚Äù like betting the government‚Äôs cash flow on digital tokens and market hype. 

This new plan forces stablecoins to be backed by short-term T-bills. That creates an estimated $2‚Äì$3 trillion in new demand for government debt, which is nearly half the current size of the T-bill market. On paper, that looks like a win. In reality, it‚Äôs a circular feedback loop: Crypto demand fuels stablecoins, stablecoins buy T-bills, T-bills fund deficits. The government becomes addicted to speculative capital flows. And round and round we go.

It‚Äôll work great, until it doesn‚Äôt. The whole setup depends on risk appetite staying high. Thing is, crypto isn‚Äôt some stable, predictable pillar of the economy. It‚Äôs a sentiment-driven casino, where whales move markets and retail euphoria inflates bubbles. Confidence in that environment can evaporate overnight.

When the music stops, we will see a wave of stablecoin redemptions. To meet those redemptions, issuers have to dump T-bills into the open market. Yields will then spike and liquidity will dry up. Government borrowing costs jump at exactly the worst time. Suddenly, the entire short end of the Treasury curve is caught in a feedback loop running in reverse.

Crypto is becoming exactly what it claimed to replace: a systemic risk the government can‚Äôt afford to let fail. And it won‚Äôt be the VC whales or offshore exchanges who foot the bill. It‚Äôll be the taxpayers, either directly or through backdoor rescues and Fed liquidity if things unravel.

Once you tie public finance to crypto flows, the line between a market correction and a fiscal crisis starts to blur. A major stablecoin unwind won‚Äôt just hit DeFi yield chasers, it‚Äôll slam the short end of the Treasury market. That‚Äôs when the Fed and Treasury will have no choice but to step in, to stabilize yields, backstop liquidity, and calm foreign holders.

So yeah, we‚Äôre already halfway to a too-big-to-fail bailout economy for crypto. Not because it earned that privilege, but because we let it entangle itself in the core plumbing of the financial system.

This isn‚Äôt just risky, it‚Äôs desperate. You don‚Äôt latch public finances to speculative manias unless you‚Äôre out of conventional tools. And if your fiscal strategy depends on token demand holding up, you‚Äôve already lost the plot.

What makes this even more dangerous is the moral hazard baked in. We‚Äôre handing fiscal stability to unregulated private actors, namely stablecoin issuers, hedge funds, and crypto exchanges, many of whom have no oversight and no skin in the game if it blows up. Just like the shadow banks in 2008, they profit on the way up and vanish when the tide goes out.

They‚Äôre calling this ‚Äúfinancial innovation,‚Äù and anyone who questions it a Luddite. But let‚Äôs be clear: this isn‚Äôt modernization. It‚Äôs monetizing the mania and papering over structural deficits by plugging them into whatever speculative engine happens to be hot this cycle.

If this goes sideways, and history says it eventually will, it won‚Äôt just hurt crypto. It could shake global trust in U.S. debt markets, and by extension, the dollar itself. Because now our ‚Äúrisk-free‚Äù assets are being propped up by the same forces that gave us meme coins and NFT rug pulls. That‚Äôs how systems collapse, not with one catastrophic decision, but with a series of reckless bets made under the illusion that the good times will last forever.",miaminaples,54.8485,19,2025-06-19 10:10:39,"['Currency collapse speedrun!', 'It really is the perfect era to be a criminal!

In the end it increases demand for US debt (for now). \n\nStablecoins would be backed with real assets and be audited regularly so I find it hard to see HOW they would become sentiment driven? \n\nThe Fed would still be able to manage dollars, T-bills, and part of the debt. Although this could add pressure to a wave of redemptions it‚Äôs no more unusual than new big money market funds hitting the market.', 'This is well written, but short sighted. The currency and T-bill markets have been smoke n mirrors, so to speak since 1933 when FDR took the USD off the gold standard for domestic transactions and ended international convertibility of the dollar to gold in 1971 under Pres. Richard Nixon. Since at least 1971, the world has been on a Fiat money system which is not much different that what we see in the Bitcoin market today but slower. The almost comical reason for removing the dollar from the gold standard was because gold was too volatile and the constraints the gold standard imposed on governments. \n\nHistory has shown that a Fiat monetary system is no more stable than a monetary system under the gold standard, but it eliminated the burden of gold storage for federal banks, broke the connection between the gold market and the currency market and enable a supply and demand based market for the USD. \n\nWith the US Dollar replacing the British Pound as the World Currency by way of the Brenton Woods Agreement of 1944, world financial markets required countries to guarantee convertibility of their currencies into U.S. dollars to within 1% of fixed parity rates, with the dollar convertible to gold bullion for foreign governments and central banks at US$35 per troy ounce of fine gold (or 0.88867 gram fine gold per dollar), in some respect reintroducing a pseudo gold standard. This system existed until the 1977 Jamaica Accords which secured the role of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the US Dollar in international exchange and freed gold to float independent of the dollar by ending the Bretton Woods monetary system. \n\nCollectively, the events above created a Fiat monetary system which is truly smoke n mirrors depending on supply and demand. There is no intrinsic value in any world currency, which is why it is silly to worry about tying the US Dollar to yet another ‚Äúfictitiously valuable‚Äù currency.', 'Your post sounds like ""Jesus, crypto is invading our economy, we\'re doomed."" It doesn\'t have to be so dramatic as that. This is less about crypto in general. Let\'s focus on stablecoins.\n\nThe stablecoin issuers can and should be strongly regulated and fully backed by T-bills and then the insecurity you have about the ""crypto casino / speculation, etc."" isn\'t justified, imho. They will be equivalent to the USD concerning trust, they can be used in fast transactions 24/7/365 and don\'t need a working day to settle. That\'s it.\n\nThe stablecoin sector is (on average) growing strongly in the last years.\n\nWhat the government wants to achieve is, that stablecoins are also used for everyday payments. Since credit card provisions are high, there is also room to grow there as well.\n\nYes, stablecoins are also used for trading and shorting and more, sure. Yes, in a crypto bear market, when the trading turnover falls, less stablecoins will be needed. But to be clear, a stock/crypto market crash and/or strong volatility does not mean less trading and less stablecoin demand.\n\nP.S.: The stablecoin providers don\'t have to be 100% backed by T-bills. They can keep some liquidity in USD in bank accounts exactly to accomodate redemptions. Government can regulate this as well.\n\nBtw, I totally dislike the affinity of the current US president himself with shitcoins, NFTs and the rest, which allow him to collect money for his personal wealth. I find the whole thing more like a joke. But it\'s all remotely related to this topic.', ""Stablecoins are just US CBDCs... How does it have anything to do with speculation or gambling?

Issuers can also hold cash, Fed reverse-repos, or insured bank deposits. T-bills are just the most attractive slice of the allowed ‚Äúhigh-quality liquid assets.‚Äù \n\nSecond, the scale: all USD-pegged stable-coins together are about $252 billion today‚Äîroughly 4 % of the $6 trillion T-bill market, not ‚Äúhalf.‚Äù  Even the bullish Morgan Stanley forecast of $1.6 trillion in two years would still leave T-bill buyers overwhelmingly traditional. \n\nThird, redemption waves needn‚Äôt trigger a mass dump of bills. Most reserves mature within six months, and issuers can tap the Fed‚Äôs standing repo facilities if they need same-day dollars, just like money-market funds do. \n\nFourth, there‚Äôs no ‚Äúnew debt loop.‚Äù Stable-coins don‚Äôt let Treasury borrow more; they just change who is holding short-term paper. If traders swap out of bank deposits or MMFs into tokenised dollars, the debt level is unchanged.\n\nFinally, yes, speculative booms can expand stable-coin supply, but the peg itself has shown <1 % daily deviation in normal conditions. That‚Äôs a far cry from ‚Äúcasino volatility‚Äù spilling straight into the Treasury curve.\n\nSo I‚Äôd say the systemic-risk story is worth watching, especially if supply does surge into the trillions‚Äîbut today‚Äôs numbers suggest we‚Äôre a long way from the doom loop described.\n\n‚Äî Eli', 'The currency system is purely supply and demand atp. There‚Äôs no connection to trust or policy or the dollar would be worthless. There‚Äôs no real change in tying stable coins to treasuries because everything is tied together through the USD anyway! Crypto, stable coins, gold, you name it, are valued in the USD which is fiat currency with no connection to anything substantial. Everything in the world is valued in a piece of paper that has nothing or at least little to do with anything. If the value of the US dollar were truly tied policy, confidence on the US government or its national debt, it would be worthless now. There‚Äôs value exists because all the major governments of the world agreed to trade/exchange in US Dollars via the agreements above. The IMF is the real determinant of liquidity as they are the lender to governments, banks and financial centers. There‚Äôs value exists IMF controls the flow more than the Federal Reserve on a day to day and month to month basis.

China pushed out a lot of western capital and financiers in favor of other national goals and interests, so it‚Äôs not getting flooded with foreign capital like it used to, or the way fast growing economies usually have been. The Chinese came to see these western institutions as a threat (which, in fairness isn‚Äôt wrong for them to think,) and ever since they‚Äôve been pushed out there has been a hard pullback.\n\nThe Chinese generally work to devalue the Yuan relative to the USD and EUR in particular so knowing that there is intentional currency devaluation adds currency risk to owning Chinese assets.\n\nThe Chinese economy may be switching to a different larger strategic vision away from the rapid growth of capital and asset values and toward something else. Different people have different theories on what the Chinese strategic vision is, but it seems to be something different than Dengism, maybe something more rooted in Han nationalism, perhaps a return of some of their old Maoist elements, maybe even some new top- down infrastructure and development plans.

investing,Anyone here investing in land? Curious about long-term potential,"I‚Äôve been exploring land as a long-term investment and recently started looking through Mossy Oak Properties to get a feel for what‚Äôs out there. There‚Äôs a surprising range depending on location and land use, some geared toward recreation, others with development or timber value.

For example, I saw a 40-acre parcel in southern Missouri listed for about $160K with a mix of timber and pasture, seems like it could generate some income through leases. Then there‚Äôs a 20-acre property in Georgia around $95K that‚Äôs already cleared and has road access, which feels like a safer hold. They also had a 300+ acre hunting tract in Mississippi for over $800K, which is way out of my budget but interesting from a land portfolio angle.

I‚Äôm mostly focused on under-$200K properties with potential appreciation or light use (timber, lease, etc). Anyone here already investing in rural land?
